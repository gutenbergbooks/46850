<p class="noi title">THE MOTOR BOYS ON
THE WING</p>





<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>TWO QUEER MEN</small></h2>


<p>“Don’t try it Jerry, you can’t make it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can Bob. There’s more room than
you think. Besides, the hay is soft.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t, Jerry. We’re in no hurry,” put in
the third member of a trio of boys in a big touring
car that was skimming along a pleasant
country road behind a load of hay. “Don’t do
it!”</p>

<p>“Say, I’m tired of taking in all that fellow’s
dust,” returned Jerry Hopkins. “Hold fast fellows,
here we go!”</p>

<p>He pressed down the accelerator pedal of the
machine and headed the car for a narrow space
that showed between the load of hay and the side
rails of a bridge that the farm wagon was just
crossing.</p>

<p>It was a rather small opening to get through
but Jerry was a skillful steersman, and, as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
said, he had traveled behind the load of hay so
long, breathing the dust kicked up by the plodding
horses, that he was tired of it. The driver
had been obstinate and would not pull over, and
this was the first chance Jerry had had to pass.</p>

<p>“You’ll have a smash!” predicted Bob Baker.</p>

<p>“Not on your life, Chunky!” called back Jerry.</p>

<p>“Hug the hay—not the bridge—those side
rails may be rotten,” advised Ned Slade, as he
took a firm grip on the lap-robe rail in front of
him.</p>

<p>“Right you are,” admitted Jerry. “Here’s
where we hit the red top and timothy. All ready
now!”</p>

<p>The big car shot ahead. The farm wagon was
rumbling over the bridge, which was none too
strong, and when the auto also reached the clattering
planks it sounded as if a thunder storm had
broken loose.</p>

<p>With quick eyes and ready hands Jerry guided
the car. Close up against the sides of the billowy
hay he sent the machine to avoid hitting the
bridge rail, yet so narrow was the space that the
hub caps raked a furrow in a retaining plank,
while the hay whipped the faces of the autoists.</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“Farther over—farther!” cried Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, all right. Don’t get excited,” advised
Jerry calmly. “We’re safe now.”</p>

<p>They would have been, in another instant, for
with a quick turn of the steering wheel the tall
lad on the front seat was about to send the car
cutting in ahead of the horses, having nearly
passed the wagon. But whether the steeds were
frightened by the shouts of Ned and Bob, or
whether the driver unconsciously or intentionally
turned toward the auto was not known. At any
rate only by a rapid shifting of his course was
Jerry able to avoid a collision. He screwed the
wheel around to the left, and then, as he saw
that he was running the front tires into the bridge
rails he twisted his “helm” once more to the right.
By this time the end of the bridge was reached,
and Jerry saw an open road ahead of him, having
emerged from behind the hay wagon.</p>

<p>He cut sharply into it, so sharply in fact that
the mud guard on the right rear wheel scraped
the nigh horse, causing the animal to swerve
against its mate in fright.</p>

<p>“Whoa there! Hold on! I’ll have th’ law
on you fellers!” cried the driver of the hay load.</p>

<p>“Say, you <em>did</em> hit his horse,” remarked Bob in
a low voice.</p>

<p>“Better pull up and see if he’s going to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
trouble. Otherwise he may take our number and
report us,” advised Ned.</p>

<p>There was a grinding and shrieking of brakes
and the auto came to a stop just ahead of the
farm wagon, the driver of which had now quieted
his horses.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he roared, as he dismounted,
whip in hand. “What right you got
to smash into me that way?”</p>

<p>Jerry stood up in the machine, and looked at
the steeds before replying. A quick glance told
him that beyond a mere scratch that had not even
drawn blood, the horse he had struck was not
injured. Then the tall lad replied.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mister Man. I don’t want any
of your talk!”</p>

<p>“Oh you don’t; hey? Wa’al, I’m goin’ to give
you some, an’ then I’m going to make a complaint
agin ye!”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not,” declared Jerry with easy assurance.
“In the first place you’re a road-hog
of the worst type. We kept behind you for
nearly a mile, swallowing your dust, and, though
there were several places where you could have
turned out, and let us pass, you wouldn’t do it.
I got tired of tooting my horn, and when I saw
a chance to slip by I took it. I wouldn’t have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
barked your horse, if you’d kept to your own
side of the bridge, and you know it.</p>

<p>“As it is, your animal isn’t hurt a bit, but you
were nearly the cause of something serious happening
to us. Now go ahead and make a complaint
if you dare. We’ll come right back at you
with a worse one for obstructing the road.
That’s all I’ve got to say to you, and you can put
it in your pipe and smoke it! Hold fast, fellows,
here we go!” And with that Jerry threw
in his gear, let the clutch slip into place and they
were off down the road before the angry and
chagrinned farmer could think of anything to say.</p>

<p>When he did get his brain to working all he
could ejaculate was:</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I’ll be gum-swizzled! Them auto
fellers is gittin’ wuss an’ wuss every day. I wish
I’d upsot ’em!”</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums were too far off, however,
to hear this uncharitable wish, and it would probably
have given them little concern had it come
to their ears.</p>

<p>“Whew! That was hot while it lasted,” remarked
Bob, breathing easily for the first time
since the beginning of the little scene.</p>

<p>“You certainly had his number all right,
Jerry,” said Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, there are too many farmers like him,”
retorted the tall steersman. “We autoists don’t
want any more than our rights on the road.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that’s one disadvantage of traveling
in an auto,” went on Ned, when they were once
more skimming peacefully along the highway.
“Now if we’d been out in our motorship <i>Comet</i>
we shouldn’t have had any trouble at all.
There’s no blockading of the roads up there,”
and he motioned to the blue sky above them.</p>

<p>“No, it’ll be some time before we have to take
anybody’s dust up in the air,” was Bob’s opinion.</p>

<p>“Still the upper regions are more crowded
than when we first took to ‘sky-larking,’” spoke
Jerry. “Especially at an aviation meet. Which
reminds me that I saw something in a
paper I bought back there in Hammondport
about a big gathering of birdmen that’s to take
place soon.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Didn’t have time to look,” replied Jerry.
“Here, you and Ned have a peep at it. If the
meet is anywhere around here we might take it
in.” Jerry reached in his pocket, and pulled out
a folded newspaper. He passed it back to Ned,
who exclaimed a moment later:</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, we ought to take this in. It’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
going to be great, and maybe we can pull down
one of the prizes.”</p>

<p>“Where’s it to be?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“At Colton.”</p>

<p>“And where’s Colton?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Not far from the city of Harmolet. We
stopped there once to fix up after a blowout.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember that place!” exclaimed Bob.
“It was there we had such a jolly chicken pot-pie
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Hum! Yes! Trust Bob to remember anything
that had ‘eats’ in it,” came from Jerry, with
a chuckle. “But Colton isn’t so far away. We
could take it in. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I’m for it,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“Same here,” added Bob. “But, speaking of
chicken pot-pie makes me hungry. There’s a
good hotel just ahead and what’s the matter with
stopping there for dinner?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, I guess,” conceded Jerry. “We’re
out for a good time, and we might as well have
it. We’ll stop for grub, fellows, and then we
can talk about this meet.”</p>

<p>A run of five minutes more brought them to a
small country town called Freedon, where they
ran their car under the hotel shed, and were soon
arranging for dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>While waiting for the meal to be served the
boys sat in the hotel lobby, which contained quite
a few persons; farmers who had come in on business,
or to sell produce, traveling men, and one
or two well dressed persons, apparently auto
tourists like our heroes.</p>

<p>Two men in particular attracted the attention
of Jerry and his chums. They were dark-complexioned
chaps, evidently used to being out of
doors, and their quiet but expensive clothes betokened
that they were well off, or posed as being
in that condition.</p>

<p>But it was neither the clothes nor the appearance
of the men that attracted the attention of
the boys as much as their manner. They sat together,
not far from the hotel clerk’s desk, and
sharply scrutinized every person in the lobby.
Nor did our friends escape observation. The
dark, eager, shifting gaze of the two men rested
on the boys from time to time, and then darted
off toward newcomers.</p>

<p>“Have either of you seen those two men before?”
asked Jerry of Ned and Bob, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Bob, who because of his fleshiness
was still panting from the exertion of climbing
the hotel steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“How about you, Ned?”</p>

<p>“I agree with Chunky,” was the other lad’s reply,
giving his stout chum his often-used nickname.
“But they certainly will know us if they see us
again.”</p>

<p>“They sure will,” came from Jerry. “But now
let’s have a look at that paper. I want to read
about the meet. Where did you say it was to
take place Ned? I mean that aviation meet.”</p>

<p>“At Colton, near Harmolet. We could put up
at Harmolet I think, for there are not likely to
be many accommodations in Colton. I know
there is a good hotel in Harmolet.”</p>

<p>“Then Harmolet for ours!” exclaimed Bob in
rather a loud voice. “I think—”</p>

<p>At the mention of the name of that city the
two queer men, as if moved by the same impulse,
stared straight at our heroes. The eyes of Jerry
met first those of the man nearest him, and then
shifted to the face of his companion. The two
men hastily glanced away, and then, as Bob, who
had noticed their strange action and who had interrupted
himself, resumed his remarks about the
desirability of Harmolet as a stopping place, the
two strangers whispered eagerly together.</p>

<p>“Hum,” mused Jerry. “That’s rather odd.
They must know something about Harmolet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s not strange, seeing that it’s a good-sized
place,” observed Ned. “But I don’t believe
I’d care to have anything to do with those
chaps—especially after dark,” he added in a low
voice. “I don’t like their looks.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” agreed Jerry. “But we’re not
likely to have anything to do with them. Now
about this meet. If we’re going we’ll have to
give our motorship <i>Comet</i> an overhauling,” and
with that our friends fell to talking of air travel,
in which they were well-nigh experts.</p>

<p>Dinner was presently announced, and the boys
went up to the hotel desk to register. Just in
front of them were the two strange men, whose
conduct had been the cause of some speculation
among the three lads. The men put their names
down on the books just ahead of Jerry Hopkins.</p>

<p>“Hum—James Brown and John Black,” mused
Jerry as he looked at the signatures. “Couldn’t
be any more common names than those I guess.”</p>

<p>“Where are they from?” asked Bob, for Jerry
had registered for his two chums.</p>

<p>“It might be almost any place,” was the answer,
“for it’s such a scrawl that I can’t read it.
Brown and Black; eh? Well, they’re both dark
complexioned enough to be called ‘black.’ However
let’s go in to dinner. I hope we don’t sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
anywhere near them. It would spoil my appetite
to be stared at the way they have been looking
at us.”</p>

<p>“It’ll take a good deal to spoil <em>my</em> appetite,”
observed the stout lad with a heart-felt sigh.</p>

<p>The fears of our heroes were groundless, for
they were seated well away from the two odd
men, and they managed to do ample justice to the
meal.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>WARNED AWAY</small></h2>


<p>“Well,” observed Bob, after an eloquent
silence, during which knives and forks had been
industriously plied. “Now I’m ready to talk
business. When do you think we can go to that
meet, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“As soon as we like, or, rather, as soon as it
opens, which isn’t for two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Will you try for a prize?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why we can’t,” was the opinion
of the tall lad. “I wish they had some water
there, so we could do some stunts with our hydroplanes,
as we did when we rescued Mr. Jackson.
That was a trip worth taking.”</p>

<p>“It sure was,” agreed his chums. “Maybe we
can soon take another like it.”</p>

<p>And they fell to talking of their adventures in
the past, and of those hoped for in the future.</p>

<p>While they are thus engaged I will take the
opportunity of telling you something more about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the boys, for I may not get another chance, as
they are such rapid-fire chaps. Those of you
who have read the previous books in the series
need no introduction to the motor boys, but new
readers may wish to be formally presented to
them.</p>

<p>The boys were Jerry Hopkins, the son of Mrs.
Julia Hopkins, a wealthy widow, Bob Baker,
whose father, Andrew Baker, was a prominent
banker, and Ned Slade. Ned’s father, Mr.
Aaron Slade, owned a large department store.
The boys had been chums ever since they were in
the primary school, and when they were old
enough to have motorcycles their friendship was
more than ever firmly cemented, for they had
many adventures together, as told in the first
volume of this series, entitled “The Motor Boys.”
Later they got an auto, and made a long trip
overland, and some time afterward, in company
with Professor Uriah Snodgrass, they went to
Mexico to discover a buried city.</p>

<p>Coming home from Mexico across the plains
they had more adventures. With some money
they had made in a gold mine they had located,
they bought a fine motor boat, and in that they
spent many pleasant hours. The fifth volume
of our series, entitled “The Motor Boys Afloat,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
details some of them. In their craft the <i>Dartaway</i>,
they took quite a trip along the Atlantic
coast, and also down in the everglades of Florida.
Later they voyaged on the Pacific ocean, in search
of a mysterious derelict.</p>

<p>But staying on the earth, or afloat on the water
did not long content our heroes. Airships were
coming more and more into prominence, and it
was not long before our friends had a fine motorship
called the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>You will find this air-craft fully described in
the ninth volume of the series, entitled “The
Motor Boys in the Clouds,” so I will not take up
space to tell of it here. Sufficient to say that it
was a combination of a dirigible balloon and an
aeroplane, and could sail for many miles without
coming down. In it our friends had many
adventures, nearly always accompanied by Professor
Snodgrass, who was an enthusiastic collector
of bugs, reptiles, and scientific specimens of
various kinds, for a museum.</p>

<p>It was not always easy sailing for our heroes,
for in their town of Cresville, not far from Boston,
there lived a bully, Noddy Nixon by name,
who with his crony, Bill Berry, made much
trouble for them. But our friends generally got
the best of Noddy in the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The motor boys made a long trip over the
Rockies in their motorship, and helped to rescue
a band of white persons who were held captives
by a strange tribe of Indians. Later, Jerry and
his chums, as told in the eleventh book of the
series made a flight over the ocean, and succeeded
in rescuing a Mr. Jackson, who with some friends
and a crew were unconscious in a dirigible balloon
that had become disabled at sea. Mr.
Jackson, as told in the story “The Motor Boys
Over the Ocean,” was being sought by Mr. Slade,
to aid him in his department store business, which
was on the verge of failure. And Ned and his
chums rescued Mr. Jackson just in time, not only
to save his life, but to prevent the ruin of Mr.
Slade’s business.</p>

<p>The boys had been back from this trip over
the ocean some time now, and, after a winter
spent at their studies, they were, with the arrival
of summer, ready for fresh adventures.</p>

<p>They had been out for a spin in their auto when
the events narrated in the first chapter took place,
and now we will resume their acquaintance in the
hotel where they are just finishing dinner.</p>

<p>“Well, shall we go on?” asked Jerry, as he
and his chums arose from the table.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s sit around a while and rest,” proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Bob. “It’s bad for digestion to hustle
around right after a meal.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing the matter with <em>your</em> digestion,”
declared Jerry with a laugh. “But I guess
it won’t hurt us to sit around a bit. Who’s got
that paper about the aviation meet?”</p>

<p>“Here it is,” replied Bob, passing it to his tall
friend.</p>

<p>“I see you are interested in airships,” remarked
the hotel clerk, for the lads were talking in front
of the desk where they had paid for their meal.
“We have other guests here today who are what
you call ‘birdmen’ I guess.”</p>

<p>“What, some aviators here?” exclaimed Ned,
and he and his two chums showed the interest
they felt.</p>

<p>“Who are they?” demanded Jerry. “I didn’t
see any one in the dining room that I’ve ever met
in a dirigible or aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps these fellows are amateurs, but
they came sailing here all right in one of those
air machines—I don’t know enough about ’em to
tell whether or not it’s a dirigible balloon or a
monoplane,” said the clerk with a laugh. “But
they’re here.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked Jerry again.</p>

<p>“Those two dark-complexioned men standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
over near the door,” replied the clerk, nodding
his head in that direction.</p>

<p>“What? Not Brown and Black?” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>“I think those are their names,” went on the
clerk, as he looked at the register. “We had
quite a crowd here to-day—yes, it’s Brown and
Black all right, though I don’t know which is
which.”</p>

<p>“Brown and Black,” mused Jerry. “I never
heard of their doing any great stunts in a dirigible
balloon or aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“No, they’re only amateurs, they told me that
when they arrived,” went on the clerk. “They
came out from Boston, and are going back soon.
It’s a trial flight for them.”</p>

<p>“Where’s their machine?” asked Bob eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, could we get a look at it?” put in Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” spoke the clerk doubtfully.
“They told me they didn’t want to be bothered
with a crowd, and they stored their machine in
an enclosed lot back of the carriage sheds.
There is a high fence all around it, and the gate
is locked. But as long as you boys are air navigators
yourselves I guess Mr. Brown and Mr.
Black won’t mind if I let you look at their machine.
They are busy talking now, anyhow, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
you can slip out and take a peep at it. Here’s the
key to the gate. Go out this back door, down
the alley, and open the first gate you come to.
Don’t let any one else in.”</p>

<p>The boys eagerly promised, and making sure
that the two strange men were deep in a conversation,
our friends slipped out of the hotel rear
door, Jerry taking the key.</p>

<p>“Who’d ever think those fellows were birdmen?”
asked Bob, as they went along.</p>

<p>“No one,” agreed Ned. “There’s something
mysterious about them. Why are they so afraid
of any one seeing their machine?”</p>

<p>“Give it up,” answered Jerry. “We’ll soon
have a peep at it, and perhaps we can tell then.
But I don’t blame them for not wanting a lot
of farmers crowding around when they’re trying
to land or make a flight. You know what trouble
we’ve had at times.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned. “Well, there’s
the gate in the fence. Now for a look.”</p>

<p>In the midst of a small enclosure they saw the
air machine—a large-sized biplane of an up-to-date
model. It took but a glance to disclose this,
and with expressions of admiration the boys
hurried up to it, to inspect it more carefully.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s a beaut all right!” declared Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some class to it,” exclaimed Ned. “Look at
that engine! Why it’s almost as powerful as
the first one we had.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a good machine—of its kind,” admitted
Jerry. “Of course it isn’t like ours, but
it’s got a lot of speed and power, I’ll wager.
And look at that gasolene tank. Why they
could go several hundred miles with one filling.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Silver Star</i>,” read Bob, as he saw the
name of the aeroplane painted on one of the side
planes, and on the vertical rudder. “Rather a
classy name; eh?”</p>

<p>“It sure is a good machine,” went on Jerry, as
he took in the various details. “I wonder if those
fellows—Brown and Black—made it themselves,
or who did? There are some points about it
that are worth copying, if they aren’t patented.”</p>

<p>“Let’s ask ’em,” proposed Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry did not answer. He was looking at the
double seat of the aeroplane—for it was built
to carry two—and near one of the improvised
chairs was a small box, evidently for tools.</p>

<p>The cover of the box was partly raised, and
with pardonable curiosity Jerry tilted it all the
way back. He was anxious to see all the details
possible of the machine that had so interested him
and his chums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>As he got a glimpse inside the tool box Jerry
uttered a half-suppressed cry of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Look here, fellows!” he exclaimed. “See
these queer tools? First time I ever knew an
aeroplane operator to carry anything like them.”</p>

<p>“What are they?” asked Bob, peering over
his chum’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Why here’s a powerful drill, some lead
hammers, another of copper, and a drill, to be attached
to an electric light circuit. And here’s
some sort of a fusing torch, to melt or fuse a
hole through steel. What in the world can they
want with these tools in an aeroplane?”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re afraid of a break-down,”
suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“What good would an electric drill or a fusing
torch do even if they did get a break-down?” demanded
Jerry. “No, there’s something queer
here, and——”</p>

<p>“Hi there! Get away from that machine!”</p>

<p>“Clear out, you fellows! What are you doing
there?” interrupted two angry voices, and our
heroes looked up to see the two men—Brown and
Black—running towards them across the enclosed
field.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>A SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE</small></h2>


<p>Startled, the boys moved back somewhat
from the aeroplane, and waited, not without a
little apprehension, the arrival of the two strange
men. The strangers increased their speed, and
came up on the run, their faces showing the evident
anger they felt.</p>

<p>“What—what are you doing at our machine?”
panted Black, the taller of the twain.</p>

<p>“Just looking at it,” replied Jerry calmly.
“We haven’t done any damage. We’re aviators
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“We’ve made lots of flights,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>“And we know enough not to monkey with
another man’s apparatus,” added Bob. “We
were only looking at it.”</p>

<p>“What right had you to come in here?” demanded
Mr. Brown, in surly tones.</p>

<p>“Yes, who let you in?” added his companion.</p>

<p>“The hotel clerk,” answered Jerry, for the key<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of the gate in his hand was rather incriminating
evidence. “He didn’t mean any harm, but we
were very much interested when we heard that
you had come in a biplane, and we wanted to see
what type it was. We saw you were busy talking,
so we didn’t bother you. We just came out
here to have a look.”</p>

<p>“It was mighty fresh of you!” growled Mr.
Black.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ll report that hotel clerk, too,”
added Mr. Brown. “He had no business to give
you the key.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it—it wasn’t altogether his fault,” said
Bob, hoping that their friend at the desk would
not be blamed.</p>

<p>“We know whose fault it was, all right,”
snarled Mr. Black. “Now you fellows clear
out of here. We arranged, when we put up at
the hotel, that we shouldn’t be annoyed by snooping
crowds, and now——”</p>

<p>“We’re not a crowd,” remarked Ned with a
smile.</p>

<p>“None of your back-talk!” exclaimed the
shorter of the aeroplanists. “We know our own
business best. Now make tracks out of here,
quick—give me that key!” and he fairly snatched
it from Jerry’s hand. The tall lad seemed about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to say something, but he thought better of it, and
held his tongue.</p>

<p>“Go on—move!” ordered Mr. Black, as the
boys showed no inclination to walk away. “Get
a hustle on you!”</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Black had caught sight of
the opened tool box. A flash of rage seemed to
pass over his face.</p>

<p>“Who opened that box?” he snarled.</p>

<p>“I did,” replied Jerry calmly.</p>

<p>“Did you—did you take anything out?” demanded
the man, striding toward our hero.</p>

<p>“I did not,” was the quiet rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Did you dare unlock it?” demanded Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>“It was unlocked, and the cover was partly
raised when we got here,” went on Jerry. “We
wanted to see what kind of tools you carried, so
I opened it. We meant no harm, and I trust we
did none. We are sorry you take our harmless
investigation in this spirit.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure the box was open?” persisted
Mr. Black.</p>

<p>“It was,” declared Jerry, his face flushing at
this implied doubt of his word.</p>

<p>“I—I guess I unlocked it, and forgot to close
it,” put in Mr. Brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Huh! Mighty careless of you—Jake—I
mean James,” said Mr. Black, hastily correcting
himself. “Now you fellows clear out,” he went
on. “We’s going to make a flight, and we
don’t want to be bothered.”</p>

<p>Silently Jerry and his chums left the enclosure.
Mr. Black followed, and locked the gate after
them. Our heroes returned to the hotel lobby.</p>

<p>“Say, they’re regular fire-eaters,” declared
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, they get on their ears mighty quick,”
said Jerry.</p>

<p>They found the hotel clerk quite disturbed.</p>

<p>“Say, did they make much of a fuss?” he asked
anxiously. “They came for the key of the gate
directly after you boys left, and I tried to put
them off. But they wouldn’t have it, and then
I told them some aeroplanists were out looking
at their machine. Whew! They ran out as
though the sheriff was after them. Did they raise
much of a row?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not an awful lot,” said Ned, not wanting
to make the good-natured clerk worry any
more than was necessary. “I guess it’ll blow
over.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” murmured the hotel man.</p>

<p>The queer aviators did not seem disposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
make any further trouble, for presently a stable
man appeared with the gate key, saying that the
two men were about to leave in their airship.</p>

<p>“They hadn’t time to come in an’ bring the
key,” he explained. “I’m goin’ out an’ see ’em
fly.”</p>

<p>The news soon spread around through the
hotel that an airship was going up, and a crowd
rushed out to see the start. The high fence of
the enclosure prevented the ground-maneuvers
from being viewed, but presently there was a
clatter as the motor started, and soon a bird-like
shape arose above the fence.</p>

<p>“There they go!” cried the throng, and our
heroes and the others saw the two men seated in
their machine mounting rapidly upward.</p>

<p>“I hope we’ve seen the last of ’em—they’re so
unpleasant,” remarked Jerry. But he and his
chums were destined to meet the two strange men
again, and under queer circumstances.</p>

<p>Discussing their encounter with Messrs. Brown
and Black, talking of the aeroplane <i>Silver Star</i>,
and planning what they would do when they took
their own motorship <i>Comet</i> to the coming aviation
meet, Jerry and his chums were soon speeding
back toward Cresville in their auto.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll see Brown and Black at the Colton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
doings, fellows,” suggested Bob. “They
seemed to be on the alert as soon as we mentioned
Harmolet.”</p>

<p>“Well, they may be there,” agreed Jerry.
“They certainly have a good machine of its class,
though I believe ours would beat it in a race.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it,” declared Ned, who took great
pride in the <i>Comet</i>. “But I can’t get over the
queer tools those fellows carried.”</p>

<p>“Me neither,” went on Jerry. “It looked to
be a lot of useless weight.”</p>

<p>This gave a new turn to the conversation, and
one thing led to another, so that almost before
our friends realized it they were near Cresville.</p>

<p>As they approached a turn in the road, they
heard behind them frantic tooting of an auto
horn, and the loud throbbing of a cut-out muffler.</p>

<p>“Some one’s in a hurry,” observed Jerry, steering
over to one side.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a doctor on an emergency case,”
suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Doctor nothing!” retorted Ned, after a look
to the rear. “It’s Noddy Nixon, and he’s coming
on at a terrific clip. Look out Jerry! He’ll
do something spiteful just for fun. Keep over.”</p>

<p>“I’m over as far as I dare go,” replied the tall
lad. “I don’t want to slide into the ditch,” for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the road at this point was bordered by deep
marshy gutters on either side. It had rained
that morning, and the hollows of the road were
filled with muddy water.</p>

<p>On came Noddy, his horn wildly tooting, and
his cut-out muffler thundering like a battery of
small guns. His machine was increasing its speed
every moment.</p>

<p>“He’d better look out on the turn,” said Jerry
to his chums, as he slowed up.</p>

<p>With a whizz and a roar the machine of the
bully passed the one containing our heroes.
This was at a point on the road where there was
a big puddle. Into it splashed the big-tired
wheels of Noddy’s car, and instantly a shower
of dirty water was sprayed all over our friends,
drenching them, and soiling their trim car.</p>

<p>“Wow!” yelled Noddy in derision as he passed.
“Wow! Look out for me! I’m a terror!”</p>

<p>“You’re a sneaking coward! That’s what you
are!” shouted Ned, wiping the muddy drops from
his face.</p>

<p>“By Jinks! Look at my clothes!” wailed Bob.</p>

<p>“The sneak!” burst out Jerry. “I’ll fix him
for that!”</p>

<p>“Take after him!” urged Ned. “We can
beat his car all to pieces! Overtake him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
we’ll haul him out and rub his nose in the mud!
The cad!”</p>

<p>“I’ll catch him all right!” declared Jerry
grimly. “We’ll get even with him for this, all
right.”</p>

<p>It was the work of but an instant to turn on
more power, and the speedy car of our motor
boys shot ahead down the road after the fast-disappearing
vehicle of the bully.</p>

<p>“There! He made the turn!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“And on two wheels,” murmured Jerry.
“He’s taking chances.”</p>

<p>On thundered the pursuing auto. Jerry slowed
up at the turn, but even then he took it at such
speed that the machine skidded unpleasantly.</p>

<p>Once more they swung out into a straight
stretch, and as they did so there came a simultaneous
cry of surprise from the three boys.</p>

<p>For there before them, off to one side, and
stuck deep in the muddy road-side ditch, was the
car of Noddy Nixon. But the bully was not in
it, nor was he in sight. He had suddenly disappeared.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>NODDY NIXON’S PLIGHT</small></h2>


<p>“What can have happened to him?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s his auto; isn’t it?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Surely,” answered Jerry. “No mistaking
that; but Noddy isn’t in it—that is unless he
was knocked unconscious and has slipped under
the seat.”</p>

<p>“Let’s look,” proposed Ned. Jerry had
brought their own car to a stop, and as the three
lads alighted, peering anxiously toward the
stalled machine for a sight of the bully, they were
startled by hearing a groan of distress.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“It sounded like—him!” declared Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh—Oh fellows—help me—Oh I’m—I’m
stuck!” exclaimed a woe-begone voice.</p>

<p>Simultaneously our friends turned their gaze
in the direction of the cry. It came from a slimy
black pool of mud and water, off to the left of
the Nixon car, which was in the slough over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
hubs. The sight that met the gaze of Jerry and
his chums was enough to excite their pity, even
though the victim was their worst enemy.</p>

<p>Noddy Nixon was standing in the mud puddle
which came considerably over his waist, and from
the condition of his face, it was evident that he
had been flung in head first, and had, after a
struggle righted himself. He was covered,
streaked, spotted and speckled with the black,
slimy mud. It dripped from his shoulders,
dripped from his extended hands, and even oozed
from his chin in a slimy stream.</p>

<p>For a moment our heroes gazed at him without
speaking, then Jerry uttered an expression combining
surprise, dismay and pity.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“He certainly is all in,” was Ned’s opinion.</p>

<p>“Good and proper,” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>Probably the hardest thing Noddy Nixon ever
had to do was to appeal for help to the three boys
whom he had, many times in the past, used so
meanly. Yet there was no way out of it.</p>

<p>“Oh—oh, fellows,” he faltered. “See if you
can’t help me out of here. I—I’m stuck.”</p>

<p>“How’d you get there?” asked Jerry for want
of something better to inquire about.</p>

<p>“I—I stopped my car too suddenly,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the bully trying to wipe some of the mud from
his face with a still muddier hand. “It skidded,
and I put on the brakes hard, and I was flung
out.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t pick out a very good place to land
in,” grimly remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“Guess he didn’t have time,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t you going to help me out?” begged
Noddy.</p>

<p>“Do you mean help you out, or your car?”
asked Jerry. “Why can’t you wade over to solid
ground? Then we’ll help you pull out your car.
That’s stuck pretty bad too.”</p>

<p>“No, I—I can’t wade out,” replied Noddy
helplessly. “I’m in a sort of muck, or quicksand.
Everytime I try to take a step I go in
deeper. I need a board or a fence rail, or—or
something to help me. Oh, please, fellows—I
know I’ve been mean to you—but forgive me and
help me out!”</p>

<p>“It’s about time you got wise to the fact that
you did us some mean turns,” spoke Ned. “How
about splashing mud on us a little while ago?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I did that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are now, but the next time you get
the chance you’d do the same thing,” declared
Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, honest I won’t!” promised Noddy, and he
was in earnest—at least for the time being.</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t deserve to have us help you
out, but we can’t see you in this plight without
doing something,” went on Jerry. “Try once
more to pull yourself out. I don’t fancy getting
all covered with mud.”</p>

<p>Noddy tried, but it was of no use. The more
he struggled to free himself, the deeper he sank,
and he was evidently very much alarmed—so
much so that he began to blubber.</p>

<p>“Oh, now, stop bellowing, and we’ll help you,”
cried Ned, much disgusted by the cowardice of
the bully. “Come on, fellows, get some fence
rails, and we’ll see what we can do.”</p>

<p>The rails were brought, and extended to Noddy
in a sort of criss-cross platform to support him.
In placing them our friends got in the mud over
their shoes, but there was no help for it. Presently
Noddy was able to bear part of his weight
on the rails, and then, by a vigorous effort, he
managed to pull his legs loose from the grip of
the sticky mud. He crawled out on the firm
ground, a worse looking sight than Jerry and his
chums had seen for many a day.</p>

<p>“Look at me!” gasped Noddy in dismay, as he
glanced down at his legs. “Look at me—Oh!—Oh!
It’s—it’s—awful!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better look for a clean puddle of water and
roll in it,” advised Ned, trying not to smile.</p>

<p>“If you had a lot of newspapers you could wipe
some of it off,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“Or some rags from your auto,” put in Jerry.
This mention of the car recalled to Noddy the
plight of his machine. He looked over to where
it was firmly imbedded in the slough, and said:</p>

<p>“Will you help me get it out, fellows?”</p>

<p>“It’s in pretty deep,” observed Jerry, going
closer and taking a critical observation.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get some wide boards and put
them under the wheels,” was Ned’s opinion.</p>

<p>“Maybe we could pull it out with our car, if
we had a long rope,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s the very thing!” exclaimed Jerry. “I
guess we can pull it out, Noddy—but next time,
don’t go so fast—especially around a curve.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not,” promised the miserable bully.</p>

<p>“And don’t steer out of your way to splash
mud on people from whom you may want help
afterward,” suggested Ned significantly.</p>

<p>“I—I won’t,” declared Noddy. “Oh, fellows
if you’ll only pull my car out for me I’ll
pay you well. My father said if I had any more
accidents I couldn’t run it again this summer.
I’ll do anything you say if you’ll pull it out.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want any of your money,” half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
growled Jerry. “There’s one thing about it
though, you’ve got to wade in there yourself to
attach the rope; that is if we can get one.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a long rope in the car!” exclaimed
Noddy eagerly. “I always carry one, for I was
stuck in the sand once. I’ll go in and get it, and
fasten it to my car. Then I’ll bring the end out
here, and you can attach it to your machine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess you’d better do the wading,”
said Ned, for to get to Noddy’s stalled car
it would be necessary for some one to go
in the muck up to his knees, and none of our
heroes relished this. “You can’t be much muddier
than you are Noddy,” finished the merchant’s
son.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” promised the bully eagerly, and
having gotten rid of some of the muck on his
face and hands he stepped into the miniature
swamp, and was soon attaching the rope to the
rear of his car. Then he brought the free end
out to firm ground where Jerry received it.
Then, having turned his auto around, the tall
lad made the cable fast to the rear of his machine.</p>

<p>“Come on now, fellows, get in our car to hold
it down when the strain comes,” suggested Bob
to his chums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“All ready?” asked Ned of Noddy, a little
later.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the faltering answer.</p>

<p>Jerry threw in the gear, and let the clutch slip
into place. The car of our heroes went forward
a little way, and then began the strain on the rope.
The strands straightened out, there was a creaking
sound, but Noddy’s auto did not budge.</p>

<p>“Try more power, Jerry,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>The tall lad turned on all the gasolene he
dared. The rear wheels of his auto spun uselessly
around in the wet dirt of the highway.</p>

<p>“Wow! Stop!” cried Bob. “You’ll rip off our
tires.”</p>

<p>“I guess we can’t stir you, Noddy,” called
Jerry, as he shut off the power.</p>

<p>“Oh, try! Try once more!” begged the bully.</p>

<p>Jerry did not relish his task much, but he did
try. Once more the rope became taut. There
was a great strain on it. Once more the wheels
of the pulling auto spun around. Still Jerry kept
the power on.</p>

<p>Noddy’s car quivered in the mud that held it
fast. It moved not an inch, however.</p>

<p>“Go on! Go on!” yelled the bully encouragingly.</p>

<p>“You’ll ruin our tires!” cried Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry, with a grim look on his face turned on
the least bit more gasolene. Then, with a crack
like that of a revolver the rope snapped, and one
end of it flew dangerously close over the heads
of our heroes in their car. For when a rope on
which there is a great strain breaks suddenly, it
is a dangerous missile.</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled Ned, as he saw the end of
the cable hurling toward himself and his chums.
They ducked just in time. The other end flopped
down in the mud behind Noddy’s car.</p>

<p>The bully looked disconsolate.</p>

<p>“Have to try it again, I guess,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Not much!” declared Jerry decisively.</p>

<p>“Wha—what?” gasped Noddy.</p>

<p>“No more tries for us,” went on the tall lad.
“You’ve stuck too fast for us to pull you out,
Noddy. What you need is some pulleys and a
derrick. We can’t risk breaking our car, and
ripping off the tires. You’ll have to stay there
until you can get some one else to pull you out.”</p>

<p>Jerry detached the broken rope from his car,
and got in again.</p>

<p>“You—you aren’t going away and leave me;
are you?” faltered Noddy.</p>

<p>“You guessed it,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, please pull me out!” pleaded the bully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“We can’t,” spoke Jerry, not unkindly. “It’s
impossible, Noddy. That mud has too firm a
hold on your wheels. The best we can do is to
stop at the nearest garage and tell them about
you.”</p>

<p>The bully begged and pleaded by turns, and
offered the boys a large sum of money; but though
our heroes would have helped him, in spite of his
former meanness, it was out of the question.
They could not afford to damage their own car,
and risk getting hurt by a breaking rope.</p>

<p>“Sorry to leave you, but we must,” called
Jerry, as he sent the auto slowly ahead. They
turned toward Cresville, leaving Noddy standing
on the brink of the muck-hole, gazing disconsolately
at his stalled auto, while the mud and
water dripped from him at several points, and
formed little puddles at his feet.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>A SIGHT OF THE BIPLANE</small></h2>


<p>“Say, things haven’t done a thing but happen
to us today,” remarked Bob, when they were nearing
the broad, smooth highway that led directly
into Cresville.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned. “Meeting those
two queer men, having them nearly take our
heads off because we looked at their aeroplane,
and then this mix-up with Noddy.”</p>

<p>“Noddy got <em>his</em> all right,” observed Jerry
grimly. “I don’t believe, even if we’d caught
him, and given him a well-deserved licking, that
he’d be any worse off.”</p>

<p>“It was retributive justice with a vengeance,”
was Ned’s further opinion. “But, speaking of
queer happenings, what do you make of Brown
and Black?”</p>

<p>“Can’t make much of them,” spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what those tools were,” came
from Jerry. “They were the queerest combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
I ever saw on an aeroplane. We carry a lot
on our <i>Comet</i>; but nothing like those, and we’ve
got twice as much complicated machinery as those
fellows have.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Ned. “Well, we’ll soon be
out in the motorship again if we conclude to go
to the aviation meet; and maybe they’ll have some
new tools on exhibition there.”</p>

<p>“We’ll certainly go,” agreed Jerry. “Automobiling
is all right if you’ve never sailed in
the air, but once you have skimmed along above
the clouds—”</p>

<p>“You want to keep at it,” finished Bob. “But
say, we mustn’t forget to stop, and send help out
to Noddy. He’s human, even if he has done us
many a mean turn.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. We’ll stop at Mason’s garage
and tell them,” suggested Jerry. “I think——”</p>

<p>But what he was thinking about he never mentioned,
for at that moment he and his chums
were aware of a curious throbbing and humming
sound in the air, far above their heads. With
one accord they gazed upward, and the sight they
saw caused Jerry suddenly to shut off the power,
and bring the auto to a stop.</p>

<p>“An aeroplane!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“A biplane,” supplied Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“And going fast, too!” added Jerry. “Say,
but they’re eating up the air-space all right!”</p>

<p>“I wonder if that can be Mr. Jackson?”
ventured Ned.</p>

<p>“He’s far enough from here,” declared Jerry,
referring to the millionaire whom they had so
thrillingly rescued from his disabled dirigible
balloon over the ocean.</p>

<p>“Whoever it is, he knows how to handle the
craft all right,” declared Ned. “Look at that
spiral dip he’s making.”</p>

<p>As he spoke the air machine came down a little
way in a corkscrew curve.</p>

<p>“Wait!” exclaimed Jerry impetuously as he
reached back in the tonneau and took from a
pocket in the side a pair of powerful field glasses.
“We’ll see what these show,” he went on, as he
focused them on the distant aeroplane.</p>

<p>No sooner had he gotten the aircraft in his
range of vision than he uttered a startled cry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded Ned.</p>

<p>“Some one you know?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that we have the honor of their
acquaintance,” spoke Jerry slowly, “but if that
machine isn’t the <i>Silver Star</i> I’ll buy you fellows
ice cream sodas—that’s all! Here, Ned, have
a look.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry passed his chum the glasses, and no
sooner had the merchant’s son gotten a good
view than he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“You’re right! It’s Brown and Black sure
enough.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you can make out faces
at that distance,” exclaimed Bob incredulously.
“Let me have a peep.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see their faces,” declared Ned, “but
I’m sure it’s them, for it’s their machine, and
they’re so touchy that they wouldn’t let any one
else run it. It’s them sure.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” commented Jerry. “Those
are the two mysterious men we met at the hotel.”</p>

<p>“I wonder where they’re going?” mused Bob,
as he took another look. “They’re flying high
for amateurs.”</p>

<p>“They’ll reach Harmolet if they keep on in
that direction long enough,” declared Ned.
“It may be that they’re going to the meet at Colton.”</p>

<p>“It’s too soon for that,” was Jerry’s opinion.
“But it certainly is odd that we should see those
fellows again. Let me have another look, Bob.”</p>

<p>It was difficult now, even with the powerful
glasses, to discern the aeroplane, for it was almost
hidden in the haze of the upper regions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
In a few seconds more it had entirely disappeared,
and Jerry putting up the field glasses,
started the auto.</p>

<p>The boys discussed the curious sight, speculating
on the destination of Brown and Black, and
then branched off on matters connected with their
own motorship. By this time they had reached
Cresville, and stopped at a garage, the owner
of which promised to send out a powerful car,
with ropes and pulleys, to haul Noddy from the
ditch.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s over,” remarked Jerry, as they
turned toward the home of the tall lad, where
the auto was kept. “We’ve had plenty of excitement.”</p>

<p>“Enough for one day,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“But it isn’t over yet,” said Bob quickly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded his chums together.</p>

<p>“There comes Andy Rush, and he acts as
though he had something to tell us,” went on the
stout lad.</p>

<p>Standing on the sidewalk, just ahead of them,
and waving his arms about like those of a miniature
windmill, was a small lad, bearing every
evidence of great nervousness. He was jumping
up and down, now running forward a few
steps, and then coming to a halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the motor boys were within hailing
distance he called to them:</p>

<p>“I say—stop—wait a minute—great excitement—maybe
somebody killed—mine blown up
perhaps—all the gold gone—maybe someone
wants to buy your motorship—special message—don’t
know what’s in it—fortune for you—maybe—here
is it—saw you coming—ran out to stop
you—I have it—open it quick—whoop! up in the
air—down again—start over—here you are!”
and with that Andy Rush, for it was indeed he,
passed over to Jerry a yellow envelope—a telegram.</p>

<p>“Are you sure that’s all, Andy?” asked the
tall lad gravely.</p>

<p>“Sure—that’s all—agent just gave it to me—I
was at the station when it came in—messenger
boys all out—I said I’d take it to you—he gave
me a dime—bought an ice cream soda—maybe
it’s bad news—I don’t know—whoop!”</p>

<p>Andy was wiggling about like an uneasy snake,
and he only had one foot on the ground at a time.
Jerry looked at the telegram, saw that it was addressed
to himself, and tore it open.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you’ve got all that out of your
system?” inquired Ned of Andy.</p>

<p>“All of what?” asked the small, excited boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“All that talk. Because if you keep any in
you might explode,” went on the merchant’s son.</p>

<p>“Better get another ice cream soda and cool
off,” advised Bob, handing Andy a dime.</p>

<p>“I will—thanks—no bad news I hope—mine
all safe—motorship not busted—I’ll cool down
soon—go to the store—drug store—half a dozen
flavors—I always take vanilla—lots of ice cream—here
I go—whoop!” and down the street Andy
started on the run.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness he’s gone,” murmured Ned
with a sigh of relief. “He gets on my nerves.
But what’s the news, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass will arrive to-morrow,”
replied the tall lad folding up the message.
“He’s on the track of some new kind of bug or
beast I suppose. He wants us to meet him at
the station.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Bob. “Now we’ll have some
more fun, and go off after a mosquito that plays
the piano, or something like that, I suppose.
Three cheers for Professor Snodgrass!”</p>

<p>“Say, you’re getting almost as bad as Andy
Rush,” commented Jerry, as he once more started
the machine, and steered it into the driveway of
his home.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>“HOLD THE TRAIN!”</small></h2>


<p>“What time will the professor get here?”
asked Ned, as he and Bob sat on the broad porch
of Mrs. Hopkins’s house.</p>

<p>“On the afternoon train, he says,” replied
Jerry.</p>

<p>“And what sort of a bug is he after now?” demanded
Bob.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t say. Not that it makes much
difference. All is grist that comes to his mill,
and if he can’t get an ant with pink legs, he’ll take
a June bug with purple wings. But be on hand
to meet him, fellows, and we’ll go down to the
station together to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Say, if he doesn’t get in until then we’ll have
time in the morning to make a flight in the
<i>Comet</i>,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Then we can see what we have
to do, to get it in shape for the Colton meet,”
added Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m with you,” declared the tall lad. “Let’s
go on out now and have a look at it. And say—you
fellows stay to supper at my house, and
we’ll go all over the <i>Comet</i> this evening.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” commented Bob, with a sigh of
satisfaction. He knew of old the skill of the
Hopkins cook.</p>

<p>“Very good—especially the supper part; eh,
Chunky?” put in Ned with a laugh. “I’ll telephone
home, and tell mother that I’m going to
stay.”</p>

<p>Bob did the same thing, and after the meal,
which Bob declared was the best he ever ate
(though he was always saying that) the boys
went out to the aeroplane shed which was in a
large field, owned by Mrs. Hopkins, and some
distance from her house.</p>

<p>“Now Jerry, be careful,” the widow cautioned
them as they left. “You remember once you had
trouble at the shed, when Noddy Nixon bound
Sud Snuffles, the watchman, and took the aeroplane
away. Look out for bad characters there.
I wish it was nearer the house—especially when
night comes on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’ll be no danger from Noddy Nixon
to-night mother,” declared Jerry with a laugh.
“Noddy is stuck in the mud too fast to get out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
a hurry,” and he told of the bully’s plight.
“But we’ll be on the lookout. We don’t keep
Sud on guard any more.” For following his
unscrupulous theft of the motorship, the bully
had been more careful how he interfered with
the property of our heroes, and there was no
necessity of a watchman at the shed.</p>

<p>The boys spent some time going over the motorship.
They had not used it in the past two
weeks, on account of bad weather; but they found
it in good shape, and, after a few adjustments
and a tightening of the guy wires, it was ready
for service.</p>

<p>“We’ll take a flight in the morning,” decided
Jerry, as he and his chums left the shed, making
sure that the doors were securely fastened.</p>

<p>“And maybe we’ll meet that other aeroplane—the
<i>Silver Star</i>,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Not much likelihood of that,” declared Bob.
“Those fellows are up to some game, I think.”</p>

<p>“What game?” demanded Jerry quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” was the somewhat uncertain
reply of the stout lad, “only I have my suspicions
of them.”</p>

<p>“So have I,” admitted Ned, “only I don’t know
what I’m suspicious of.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to get to bed,” announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the tall lad with a yawn. “Be on hand early fellows,
and we’ll go off on a little flight.”</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned were on hand in good time at
the aeroplane shed the next morning. They
wheeled the craft out into the broad, level starting
place, and proceeded to tighten the few wires
they had overlooked the night before.</p>

<p>As has been told in previous books of this
series, the <i>Comet</i> was a combined dirigible balloon
and aeroplane. By means of a powerful
gas, forced into a container above the aeroplane
proper, it could ascend as a balloon, or it could
scud along over the ground on bicycle wheels and,
when sufficient momentum had been obtained it
could rise by means of the tilted forward lifting
planes, and maintain itself as long as it was in
motion.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Bob, I wonder?”
remarked Jerry as he went in the engine room,
to look at the motor.</p>

<p>“Oh, probably he’s eating his second breakfast,”
replied Ned, who was inspecting the gas
machine.</p>

<p>“She isn’t making vapor very fast,” spoke
Jerry, as he looked at the dial of the containing
tank, and noted how much of the lifting gas was
in storage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, it needs a new valve,” decided Ned.
“But we can go up as an aeroplane, and by the
time we get up a mile or two there’ll be gas
enough.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was a roomy craft. There was a
good-sized dining room, plenty of sleeping
apartments, a storeroom, a large motor compartment,
a neat little galley or kitchen, where Bob
spent much of his time, and a living room, where
they all gathered during the day to read, talk
or make observations as they scudded through
space, high above the earth.</p>

<p>“I wish Bob would come, if he’s going to get
here,” went on Jerry. “He is always more or
less late. We won’t have time to get anywhere
before we have to be back again to meet the professor.”</p>

<p>“There he comes now,” exclaimed Ned, as he
caught sight of a stocky figure hurrying across
the field. “And by Jove, if he isn’t swallowing
the last of his breakfast on the run! He must
have overslept.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Chunky?” asked Jerry,
as his chum approached, panting from his unusual
speed.</p>

<p>“One of our rabbits got loose—had to chase
it—might eat up the neighbors’ fruit trees—never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
saw such a rabbit—thought I had it in the
cage half a dozen times—but it got out—that’s
what made me late.”</p>

<p>“But you stopped to get your breakfast,” observed
Ned, as he saw traces of egg on Bob’s
fat good-natured face.</p>

<p>“Sure I did! What do you think I am?
Going off on a flight without something to eat!
I had a good breakfast, and I brought along a
package of grub—I was afraid you fellows would
forget it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Chunky!” cried Jerry with a hopeless
laugh. “Will you ever get over your appetite?”</p>

<p>“I certainly hope not,” declared Bob earnestly.</p>

<p>He stowed away in a locker the food he had
brought, and then helped his chums in getting the
<i>Comet</i> ready for a flight. This was soon done.
The sharp nose of the craft was pointed down the
long smooth starting slope, and the motor started.
The big propellers whirred around like the blades
of an electric fan, and the motorship quivered
from end to end. The engine increased its speed
under the skilful handling of Jerry Hopkins, and
then, with a rush, the trim air machine glided
forward.</p>

<p>Faster and faster it forged ahead, the motor
thundering with its rapid explosions. Just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Jerry was about to tilt the lifting planes, there
came a faint hail from back near the shed.</p>

<p>“Hold on—wait—give me a ride—I’ve got
some news!”</p>

<p>“It’s Andy Rush!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“We can’t stop now!” shouted Jerry. “Here
we go!”</p>

<p>He yanked the plane lever toward him. Up
went the nose of the <i>Comet</i>, and the next instant
she was sailing gracefully through the air, mounting
higher and higher.</p>

<p>“Works better than ever,” was Bob’s opinion.</p>

<p>“Yes, I wish we had time to go to the lake,
and try the hydroplanes,” said Jerry, “but we
haven’t. I rather like landing on the water and
starting from the surface. It’s smoother than
a land start.”</p>

<p>The hydroplanes, as I related in a previous
volume, were a new feature of the <i>Comet</i>, and
worked well.</p>

<p>It was no novelty to our heroes to sail about
through the air, and as soon as they were up
sufficiently high they settled back to enjoy themselves.
The gas machine had by this time generated
enough vapor, so that they could float
lazily along if they wished, or even hang in space
without moving, save as the wind blew them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s look around and see if we can sight the
<i>Silver Star</i>,” proposed Ned, as he took down
from the rack a small but powerful telescope.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll have your trouble for your pains,”
declared Jerry, and so it proved. The strange
biplane containing the two mysterious men was
not in sight. In fact no other air craft was visible,
and, after sailing around for several hours,
and having their lunch about three miles above
the earth, our heroes descended, and stored their
craft in the shed once more.</p>

<p>“Wonder what Andy wanted?” mused Jerry.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon know,” said Bob. “Here he
comes now.” The excitable lad was observed
hurrying toward the three chums.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you wait?” he demanded. “I
had something to tell you—great news—he’ll
smash all to pieces—whoop! up in the air—down
again—race you motor boys—whoop!”</p>

<p>“He? Who are you talking about?” demanded
Ned.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon. He’s going to get an aeroplane
and race you fellows—big excitement—going
to some balloon meet—whoop!” and Andy
hopped up and down on one foot.</p>

<p>“Hump! Noddy must be up to some more of
his tricks!” exclaimed Jerry. “Well, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
bothers us as he did once before he’ll get what’s
coming to him.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think he’d want to risk any more
air flights,” ventured Ned, “especially when he
can hardly run his auto.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see what happens,” went on the
tall chum. “Whew!” he whistled as he looked
at his watch. “We haven’t more than time to
get down to the station before the professor’s
train will be in. We don’t want to disappoint
him. Sprint for it, fellows, and we’ll get to my
house and go down in the auto. Come along
Andy, if you like.”</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll go—anything for excitement—I can
run—let me steer—blow up a tire—whoop!”
and the excitable lad was off on a run with the
older boys.</p>

<p>They reached the station a little before the
train pulled in, and waited on the platform while
a crowd of passengers alighted. Among them
was a little man, rather slight in build, wearing
a pair of very strong glasses. He had on a
broad-brimmed soft hat, and around his shoulders
and hanging down his back were a number of
insect specimen boxes, held by straps or cords,
while in one hand he carried a large butterfly net.</p>

<p>“There’s Professor Snodgrass!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Jerry. “Now to hear what new quest he is on.”</p>

<p>“He looks the same as when he caught the flying-singing
fish,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“He never changes—he’s like a mummy,” declared
Bob.</p>

<p>The little scientist caught sight of his three
young friends, and gaily waved his hand, smiling
a greeting. He advanced to meet them, passing
close to the panting locomotive. As he did so
there came two shrill blasts of the air whistle, indicating
to the engineer that he was ready to
start.</p>

<p>At that instant Professor Snodgrass happened
to glance beneath the big driving wheels. In a
moment he was all excitement. His face lighted
up, off came his big hat, and, rapidly divesting
himself of his many boxes he dropped on his
knees close beside the rails.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“He’ll be killed!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“Look out!” shouted Ned.</p>

<p>“The man has been taken with a fit! Pull him
away from the engine!” begged the station master.</p>

<p>The professor heeded none of the cries.
Raising himself slightly, he waved his hand to
the engineer who, after pulling the throttle partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
open, was leaning from the cab window. The
ponderous locomotive was moving slowly.</p>

<p>“Stop the train! Stop it!” commanded the
scientist. “Stop it or you’ll kill him! Stop it I
say!” and he fairly shook his fist at the astonished
engineer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>A CURIOUS RACE</small></h2>


<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Is anybody killed?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s some one under the locomotive!
A child!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to faint! I know I’m going to
faint!” exclaimed a very fat lady, making her
voice heard above the others who had given utterance
to the excited expressions. “Catch me, some
one!”</p>

<p>But as no one seemed capable of sustaining her
weight, the fat lady concluded not to faint.
Meanwhile there was considerable excitement,
for the professor continued to kneel beside the
locomotive, making signals to the engineer to
bring the ponderous machine to a stop.</p>

<p>And the engineer did. With a face that went
white under its coating of oil and grime he
slapped on the air brakes with a suddenness that
brought the train up with a smashing bang.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Then, as the released air hissed through the
valves, the driver leaned from the cab window
and hoarsely asked:</p>

<p>“How’d he get under there? I didn’t see him.
Did I run over him?”</p>

<p>“Not quite, but almost!” exclaimed Professor
Snodgrass, as he reached under the great driving
wheels and lifted something out. “It was a narrow
escape. If you had run over this bug you
would have killed it sure, and it’s worth at least
seven dollars for my collection.”</p>

<p>“Bug!” fairly yelled the engineer. “Do you
mean to say you made all that fuss, and stopped
the train on account of a bug?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the scientist coolly. “It
is a very rare specimen of a red beetle, seldom
seen in this part of the country. I saw it on the
track just as you were about to run over it. Fortunately
I stopped you in time,” and he carefully
put the beetle in one of his specimen boxes, and
looked around for the boys.</p>

<p>“Stopped me in time! I should say you did!”
gasped the now angry engineer. “I slapped on
the emergency air when I heard you yelling that
way. I thought it was a kid under the machine.
And all for a bug—a bug! I guess that ain’t the
<em>only</em> bug around here, either,” and he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
significantly at the professor who, however, was
calmly unconscious of the glance. “Can I start
now?” sarcastically enquired the engineer, “or
is there more live stock under my driving wheels?
Hey?”</p>

<p>“No more—unfortunately,” replied the professor,
with great good nature, after a glance
under the locomotive, to make certain. “I wish
there was, but I will have to be content with this
one. Now boys, I’m glad to see you,” and he
turned to greet the three chums, who up to this
time had been too surprised at the sudden and odd
turn of events to speak to their friend.</p>

<p>“We’re glad to see you!” exclaimed Jerry,
holding out his hand.</p>

<p>“And I you!” cried the scientist. “I always
have good luck when I’m with you boys, and it
has started early this time.”</p>

<p>“So we see,” observed Ned.</p>

<p>“You haven’t changed any since our last trip,”
remarked Bob. “You’re still after specimens.”</p>

<p>“And I will be, as long as I can see, and handle
my butterfly net,” declared Mr. Snodgrass.
“Ah, there is our little excitable friend, Andy
Rush. Glad to see you, Andy.”</p>

<p>“How are you Mr. Snodgrass? My—a bug
on the rail—almost run over—great excitement—woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
nearly fainted—slam on the breaks—blow
up the boiler—hold down the safety valve—sand
the tracks—get the bug—whoop!”</p>

<p>“Yes—er—ah—um!” murmured the professor,
looking over the top of his spectacles at
Andy. “You haven’t changed either.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got the auto all ready for you,” explained
Jerry, as he led the way to the waiting
car. “You came in good season, Professor
Snodgrass, as we’re about to start off on another
little air-trip.”</p>

<p>“Not over the ocean I hope this time,” exclaimed
the scientist, “for the specimen I am now
after is not to be found at sea. So if you’re going
over the water I’m afraid I can’t be with you.”</p>

<p>“What are you after this trip?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“A green flying frog,” explained the professor
gravely. “The museum by which I am employed
needs one of these rare specimens, and I have engaged
to spend my entire vacation looking for it.
They are only to be found inland, however, and,
so far as is known, such frogs only exist in Java.
But I have made a study of the creature, and I
see no reason why it should not be discovered in
this country, especially farther west, in some of
the great forests.</p>

<p>“This frog has a sort of membrane between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
its legs, like a flying squirrel, and in addition to
that feature it has the power of changing its color
like the chameleon. Ordinarily it is light green
on top, and white on the under parts, but it may
become orange-hued, or even pink or brown. I
have great hopes of finding one, and if I do, I
will be richly repaid for my trouble, and our
museum will have a great prize.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know as we’re going any place
where there are flying frogs,” said Jerry, “but
we are going to an aviation meet, and after that
we have made no plans. We’d be glad to have
you go with us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll certainly go,” promised the professor, as
they got in the auto, and started toward Jerry’s
house, where the little scientist was to make a
visit. “Do you suppose you’ll head for the
middle west?”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” said Bob. “We haven’t been
out there in some time, and it might be well to
make a trip to see how our gold mine is coming
on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it’s going all right,” came from
Jerry, as he speeded up the car. “We get our
dividends regularly.”</p>

<p>The professor was busy arranging his specimen
boxes about him in the tonneau of the car,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
where he sat with Bob and Andy Rush. The
long-handled butterfly net was thrust down behind
the lap-robe rail, and the cloth part fluttered
in the air like a flag of distress, causing on
the part of pedestrians several curious glances
at the auto. But the professor little cared for
that.</p>

<p>“Would you mind slackening speed somewhat,”
begged the scientist as they neared Jerry’s house.</p>

<p>“Why?” inquired the tall youth.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t tell whether or not we are passing
any valuable insects on the bushes,” explained
the professor, as he peered through his powerful
spectacles at the shrubbery that lined the roadway.
“I must lose no chances of getting specimens,”
he innocently explained, “so I thought if
you could run more slowly I might sight a rare
bug or worm: Ha—there! Stop if you please,
Jerry!”</p>

<p>Jerry brought the car up with a jerk, and, almost
before it had ceased moving the professor
was out, and had darted to a blackberry bush,
net in hand.</p>

<p>He made a swoop, gathered a part of the net
in his fingers, looked closely at what was in it,
and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! it’s only a common June bug. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
thought I had a seven winged dragon fly. Go
ahead Jerry. I hope I have better luck when
I look for the flying frog?”</p>

<p>During this time Andy Rush had said little, but
the manner in which he fidgeted about on the seat,
and the way in which his lips moved, showed that
he was holding something back with a great
effort.</p>

<p>Jerry swung the car up in front of his house,
and as he and his chums and their guest alighted,
the excitable little chap asked:</p>

<p>“Say, professor, is there really a flying frog—one
that sails through the air—like an aeroplane—over
the trees—’round in a circle—faster and
faster—is there really—whoop!”</p>

<p>Andy ended up with a vigorous swinging of
his arms. The professor looked curiously at
him, and then, without a word, made a jump for
the small chap.</p>

<p>Surprise manifested on his face, Andy leaped
back out of reach of the butterfly net that was
extended toward him. The scientist took another
forward step. Andy leaped back still
more, and then, as if alarmed at the manner of
the bug-collector, the boy turned and ran down
the street.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Come back here at once! I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
you! You must not get away from me! Stop
I say!”</p>

<p>The race was on, each one running at top
speed.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him catch me! Don’t!” yelled
Andy, working his legs to their limit. “I didn’t
mean anything! I wasn’t making fun of the flying
frog! Don’t catch me!”</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop I say!” ordered the professor imperiously.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Jerry. “The professor
is angry at Andy. He thinks he’s been
making game of him. If he catches him he may
hurt the little fellow.”</p>

<p>“What, the professor? He wouldn’t hurt
a fly unless he wanted it for a specimen,” spoke
Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s what he wants of Andy—he’s
so little,” ventured Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, he’ll soon have him at the rate he’s
going,” predicted Jerry, for the scientist was now
almost up to the small fellow, who was still begging
to be let alone, while the professor was
shouting:</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop I say! Come back here at once!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>NODDY’S AEROPLANE</small></h2>


<p>How long the race might have continued no
one could have told, but unfortunately several
pedestrians got in the path of Andy and he was
forced to slacken speed. His youth and fleetness
gave him an advantage, but the professor
was used to chasing after flitting butterflies and
elusive insects, and this training stood him in good
stead. So in a few minutes he caught up to
Andy, and grasped him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Did it get away? Is it still on you?” Jerry
and his chums heard the scientist ask the small
chap.</p>

<p>“Did what get away? Is what still on me?”
gasped Andy. “Didn’t you—?” Words failed
him. He could only look and pant.</p>

<p>“Ha! I have it!” cried the professor. “The
little beauty didn’t get away. One moment,
Andy, and I’ll secure it.”</p>

<p>He made a sudden motion, and caught something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
that had been perched on the small lad’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“A red ant, one of the largest of its kind, and
a very fine specimen,” observed the professor, as
he carefully put the insect in a small box that he
took from his pocket. “You have unconsciously
been a great aid to the advancement of science
to-day, Andy. That red ant is worth at least
five dollars.”</p>

<p>“A red ant! Five dollars!” gasped Andy
Rush. “Is that why you were chasing me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure. What else did you think I
was running after you for?” demanded Mr.
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“I thought—that is—the flying frog—I
thought that you thought I was—Oh, I guess it’s
all right!” exclaimed the small chap quickly.
“You jumped at me so I was afraid I had
offended you.”</p>

<p>“Offended me? I guess not, especially when
you had a valuable red ant on you!” cried the
professor heartily.</p>

<p>“You thought he was going to scalp you; didn’t
you, Andy?” asked Ned in a low voice.</p>

<p>“That’s what I did! I couldn’t stand for that
green flying frog. I thought he was making a
joke, and I was going to say something funny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
I’m glad I didn’t—but he scared me just the
same.”</p>

<p>“The professor never jokes,” said Bob. “If
he says there is a flying frog you can depend on
it that there is one.”</p>

<p>“Come on in, fellows,” invited Jerry to Ned
and Bob, as they reached his house. “We’ll hear
what the professor has to say about his plans
for catching the flying frog, and then we’ll tell
him what we are going to do. We’ll have to
make up some sort of a program.”</p>

<p>The next hour was spent in talk, the scientist
giving some facts about the curious frog, which
he stated, could glide from the ground to low
bushes and down again, in search of its insect
food.</p>

<p>“But what about this aviation meet?” asked
the professor. “I must not be selfish and monopolize
all the talk.”</p>

<p>They told him of their plans, and also mentioned
meeting the two queer men—Brown and
Black.</p>

<p>“If we run across them at the meet I’m going
to give them a wide berth,” declared Ned. “I
don’t cotton to ’em.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“And so your old enemy, Noddy Nixon, is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to have an aeroplane?” asked the professor,
that fact having been mentioned. “Do you expect
to race with him?”</p>

<p>“Not if we can avoid it,” declared Jerry.
“He may enter his craft in the meet though, but
we haven’t seen anything of it as yet. Perhaps
it’s only a rumor.”</p>

<p>But it was more than that, as our friends found
a few days later, when as they went down to the
freight office to get some duplicate parts for their
motor, which they had ordered from the factory,
they saw several large packing cases on the platform.
The boxes were addressed to Noddy
Nixon, and were marked—“Fragile—Handle
with Care.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s his aeroplane that Andy Rush
was telling us about,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder,” agreed Jerry. “Let’s
see if we can tell where it’s from. There are
several firms making them now.”</p>

<p>They saw no harm in looking at the shipping
tag to ascertain what type of aircraft Noddy was
getting, and they had just located the card, tacked
on the end of one of the boxes, when a rough
voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Here, get away from there! What are
you trying to do; damage our machine?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys turned quickly to observe the unprepossessing
countenance of Bill Berry gazing at
them. He had come up unheard.</p>

<p>“Your machine?” murmured Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, mine—mine and Noddy’s. I’ve got an
interest in it. It can carry two. You needn’t
think you’re the only ones in town with an aeroplane,”
and Bill sneered.</p>

<p>“We were just looking to see where it came
from,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“You needn’t give yourselves the trouble,”
went on the bully’s crony. “Just keep away from
our property. We can do all the looking that’s
necessary.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What were they
doing?” demanded the angry voice of Noddy
himself, as he came quickly from the direction of
the freight office, and mounted the platform. He
had gone to sign a receipt for his property.
“What were they doing, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Oh, snooping around, as usual.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so!” cried Ned hotly.</p>

<p>“Say, if you bother with my aeroplane I’ll have
you arrested!” threatened Noddy, with a bluster.
“I intend to make a lot of flights, and if you get
in my way there’ll be trouble.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry; we’ll take good care to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
out of your way,” said Jerry significantly.
“Come on, fellows. And the next time Noddy
gets in a mud hole we’ll let him stick.”</p>

<p>“I guess Noddy means business as far as flying
goes,” remarked Ned, when they were on
their way home. “That firm he bought his machine
from makes good aeroplanes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’ll fly if he doesn’t break it the first
time he goes out,” said Jerry. “Well, he needn’t
trouble us—there’s plenty space to fly in. We’ll
go off on a little trip, and take the professor with
us when we get the motor fixed.” For the engine
of the <i>Comet</i> had developed a slight defect,
and it was decided to remedy it before going to
the meet.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the boys worked on other
parts of their air machine, while Professor Snodgrass
put in his time seeking various insects in
Cresville. He had agreed to go to the aeroplane
meet with the boys, and later they planned to
take a short flight out West, to see if there was
any truth in the Professor’s theory that the flying
frog might be discovered there.</p>

<p>They heard some reports of Noddy’s aeroplane.
An expert from the factory where it was
made had come on to Cresville to assemble it,
and also to give Noddy lessons in running it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Noddy knew something of aeronautics, though
his first attempt at flight in his tin fly had been
most disastrous.</p>

<p>“He means business,” said Jerry one day to
his chums. “I went past yesterday afternoon,
and Andy and Bill were making a trip over Mr.
Nixon’s big meadow. Noddy will fly all right.”</p>

<p>“Did he go up high?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“Not very. He was just about snipping the
tops off the daisies—regular grass-cutting work.
Afraid to go up, I guess. But say, I thought
of making a trip to-morrow. Will you fellows
come?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Ned. “We’ll take the professor,
too. He hasn’t had a ride since he came.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we take considerable food along, and
stay several days?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No, it’s too near the time for the meet,” decided
Jerry. “There are several little changes
I want to make in the <i>Comet</i> before we enter her
for a prize, and if we go scooting off around the
country we can’t get them done. Besides, there’s
always the danger of an accident that might put
us out of the race. We’ll postpone our trip until
after the meet.”</p>

<p>His companions agreed with him, and the next
morning, in company with the professor, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
started off on a day’s flight, planning to return to
Cresville before nightfall.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon went off in his machine early
this morning,” was the information Andy Rush
brought when he appeared at the big shed, for
he had been invited to make the trip with our
heroes.</p>

<p>“He did, eh?” spoke Ned. “Well, I guess
he won’t go far. Come on now, Andy, hop in.
We’re ready to start.”</p>

<p>The professor, carrying a number of specimen
boxes, and an extra long-handled net with which
he hoped to capture insects of the upper regions,
entered the cabin of the <i>Comet</i>. Jerry was in
the pilot house, with Ned and Bob standing by
to give their aid.</p>

<p>“Let her go!” cried the tall lad, as he turned
on the power, while Ned turned over the auxiliary
fly wheel that was connected with the big propellers.
They whirred around with great swiftness,
the <i>Comet</i> skimmed lightly over the ground,
and a moment later had mounted easily up into
the air.</p>

<p>“Whoop! La-la!” cried Andy Rush. “Here
we go! Up in the air! Never say die! Never
come down! Go on like the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>!
Whoop! La-la!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>A DISASTROUS FLIGHT</small></h2>


<p>Higher and higher soared the <i>Comet</i>, mounting
upward on the wings of the wind until it was
more than a mile in the air. Then Jerry brought
her to a level keel, and turned on more power.</p>

<p>“Where you heading for?” asked Ned, noting
that the machinery was running almost at the
limit of speed. “What’s the haste, Jerry? Are
you trying for a record?”</p>

<p>“Not especially, though we might as well hit
it up to see how the renovated motor works.”</p>

<p>“It works fine, if you ask me,” came from Bob.
“We haven’t traveled so fast since we were after
Mr. Jackson. But then I guess if we’re going
to try for a prize at the meet we’ll need speed.”</p>

<p>“That’s one reason,” conceded Jerry. “Another
is, that I’m going to try to get to Lake
Martin and back before night.”</p>

<p>“Ha! I see your game!” cried Ned. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
haven’t had a chance to try the hydroplanes
lately, and you are afraid they won’t work.”</p>

<p>“Not at all afraid of that,” declared the tall
lad, “but I <em>do</em> want to give them another try-out.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite a trip to Lake Martin and back
again—especially when we haven’t much food
aboard,” ventured Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the matter with you, Chunky?”
cried Jerry. “You’re always thinking of eating.
Forget it once in a while. We can easily make
the lake, and be back for supper.”</p>

<p>“If we don’t have any accidents,” put in the
fat boy, somewhat dubiously. “I’m going to see
what we have got in the galley,” and despite the
laughing objections of his companions he departed
to inspect the larder. He came back grinning
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Enough for a week!” exclaimed Bob in satisfied
tones. “I forgot that we stocked up the
other day. It’s all right. Go as far as you
like.”</p>

<p>It was quite a trip to Lake Martin, but Jerry
knew the <i>Comet</i> could easily make it. They had
gone farther than that in one day, and he wanted
to try the hydroplanes on a large body of fresh
water. He knew, or was practically certain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
that they would work all right, but they had not
been used since the trip over the ocean, when the
boys rescued Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>It was about an hour after they had started,
and the <i>Comet</i>, was speeding swiftly along, when
Mr. Snodgrass quickly arose from his seat amidships,
and with a cry of delight, rushed toward
the stern of the craft.</p>

<p>“There’s one!” he exclaimed. “One of the
upper-air mosquitoes. Look out, Bob, and I’ll
get him!”</p>

<p>With uplifted net the scientist headed for the
very end of the <i>Comet</i>. Buzzing just out of his
reach was a large insect, and so intent on its capture
was Mr. Snodgrass that he never noticed
his own danger.</p>

<p>The rear of the airship ended in a sort of open
deck or platform, that was used for various purposes.
Usually a stout iron railing enclosed it,
but, in order to make some changes, this railing
had been taken down, and had not been replaced,
though Jerry intended to do it before going to the
meet. But now the end of the craft was unprotected,
and the professor was running quickly toward
it.</p>

<p>Eager as he was to capture the insect, there
was every likelihood that he would hurl himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
off into space if he was not stopped. Ned saw
his danger and yelled:</p>

<p>“Professor! Professor! Stop! The railing
is down! Look out!”</p>

<p>The scientist either did not hear or did not
heed, but kept on.</p>

<p>“Stop the ship! Stop her! Send her down!
He’ll be killed if he falls!” cried Ned to Jerry.
There was little doubt of this, for the <i>Comet</i> was
now two miles above the earth.</p>

<p>The professor was now within ten feet of the
end of the platform, and it seemed that nothing
could save him. But Ned and Jerry, who were
looking with horror in their eyes at their friend,
reckoned without Bob. The stout lad was on
the after part of the motorship, at one edge of
the platform. He looked up as he heard the
cries, and saw the scientist coming. Then Bob
acted.</p>

<p>Instead of calling to Mr. Snodgrass, the fat
lad fairly rolled out directly in his path, and lay
there. There could be but one result. The professor,
his eyes fixed on the insect that was
fluttering before him, did not see Bob. But he
could not avoid him.</p>

<p>The next instant he had stumbled over him,
and went down in a heap, about four feet from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the end of the platform, his net slipping from his
grasp, and falling off into space.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Bob, as the breath was
knocked from him by the impact with the professor.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear boy! Did I hurt you?” exclaimed
the scientist as he slowly arose.</p>

<p>“Not—not much,” gasped the fat youth.</p>

<p>“Oh dear! My best net is gone! And the
insect has disappeared!” lamented Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“And in another minute <em>you</em> would have disappeared!”
declared Jerry half angrily. “You
must not take such chances, Professor. Only for
Bob you would have been killed.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m much obliged to Bob, I’m sure,”
said Mr. Snodgrass with a curious air. “Very
much obliged. I wonder where I can get another
handle for the new butterfly net which I must
make?”</p>

<p>“And that’s all he thinks about his narrow
escape,” commented Ned. “Say, he’ll give us
heart disease if he keeps on this way.”</p>

<p>“A miss is as good as two miles,” observed
Bob, as he rubbed his hip where the professor
had fallen on him. “I’m glad he didn’t go overboard,”
he added as he looked at the earth far
below them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The professor, after thinking the matter over,
began to realize what he had escaped, and shook
hands warmly with Bob. Then he forgot all
about the matter, in the work of making a new
handle for another net he constructed out of some
thin cloth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>Comet</i> was speeding on, and in
less time than our heroes expected they were at
Lake Martin. Jerry sent the craft down to the
surface of the water, and landed on the hydroplanes.
Then, setting the water-screw in motion,
he directed the motorship about on the lake,
to the no small amazement of some motor-boat
enthusiasts who were there. Dinner was eaten
afloat, and after giving the professor a chance
to look for the flying frog, but without success,
preparations were made for the return.</p>

<p>“I told you we could make the trip easily in
a day,” observed Jerry to his chums, as, toward
the close of the afternoon, they were nearing
Cresville.</p>

<p>“Yes, the <i>Comet</i> is doing herself proud,” declared
Ned. “I hope we take a prize with her
at Colton.”</p>

<p>“Sure we will,” insisted Bob, who was feeling
very fine because of a good dinner.</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t if we depended on you,” said
Jerry, “though I must say you keep us up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
mark on grub,” and the fat lad grinned in appreciation
of this compliment.</p>

<p>They were about three miles from home, and
were slowing up their speed, and coming down
on a long slant, when Ned, who was looking from
the window of the pilot house suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“There’s another aeroplane down there, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Where?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Hovering over that meadow. See, it’s a big
biplane, too.”</p>

<p>They looked and saw the white planes of a
large aircraft.</p>

<p>“It’s a new one—see how white the canvas is,”
commented Jerry.</p>

<p>“Looks just like the <i>Silver Star</i>,” put in Bob.
“Maybe Brown and Black have come to apologize
to us.”</p>

<p>“Not much,” answered Ned grimly.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, that’s Noddy Nixon!” cried
Andy Rush, who, strange to say, had been rather
quiet on this trip. “He has a biplane.”</p>

<p>“So he has,” agreed Jerry. “I shouldn’t be
surprised if it was Noddy, boys.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go down and see,” proposed Bob. Accordingly
the <i>Comet</i> was headed for the strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
aircraft which was slowly skimming along over
the big meadow, at no great distance above the
ground. There were two figures in it, as our
friends could observe, and they were guiding the
aeroplane about in easy circles and figures of
eight.</p>

<p>“It’s Noddy all right,” declared Jerry, when
they had come near enough to make out the occupants
of the machine, “and Bill Berry is with
him.”</p>

<p>“Let’s watch him for a while,” suggested Bob,
and his tall chum shut off the propellers, let some
gas blow from the compressor into the big bag,
so that the <i>Comet</i> floated in the air like a balloon,
at some distance above the slowly-moving
aeroplane of Noddy Nixon.</p>

<p>The bully and his crony had noticed the air-audience
and, probably to show off, they increased
the speed of their craft, though they did not ascend
any.</p>

<p>“Guess they’re afraid,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>Then Andy Rush did something, which, if his
companions could have anticipated they would
have prevented. Leaning over the side of the
<i>Comet</i>, and directing his voice at Noddy and
Bill, he loudly shouted:</p>

<p>“Hey, why don’t you go up? Don’t be afraid!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Be sports! Come on up, the air is fine! Show
us what you can do!”</p>

<p>Whether Noddy imagined it was one of the
motor boys calling thus mockingly to him was not
learned, but at any rate the bully retorted:</p>

<p>“Huh! afraid, are we? I’ll show you!”</p>

<p>There was an increase to the speed of his motor,
as our friends could tell by the more rapid
explosions, and the new aeroplane, boastfully
named the <i>Winner</i>, shot upward.</p>

<p>“We’ll show you what we can do!” cried Bill
Berry. “Go right over their heads, Noddy!”</p>

<p>“I will!” declared Noddy, and he pointed the
nose of his craft straight at the <i>Comet</i> on an upward
slant.</p>

<p>“He’s coming for us!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“He may hit us!” added Bob.</p>

<p>“Not much danger I guess,” replied Jerry.
“He ought to be able to steer well out of the
way.”</p>

<p>But the <i>Winner</i> did seem to be coming alarmingly
close to the <i>Comet</i>, and even Jerry was a bit
apprehensive.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll get some steerage way on, and move
up a bit, fellows,” decided the tall lad. But before
he could do this something happened.</p>

<p>The <i>Winner</i> was coming on rapidly. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
malevolent faces of Noddy and Bill could be
made out now. They were both grinning.</p>

<p>“We’ll cut over your heads all right!” boasted
Noddy. “We’ll show you how to fly.”</p>

<p>An instant later the nose of the <i>Winner</i> was
tilted upward still more, as Noddy shifted his
rudder. It seemed as if the new craft would
clear the <i>Comet</i>, and that Noddy would make
good his boast.</p>

<p>But just as Jerry got the propellers in motion,
and as the motorship was slowly moving to one
side the <i>Winner</i> topped her. Right over the
heads of our heroes flew Noddy.</p>

<p>Then came an ominous ripping, tearing sound,
a hissing as from compressed air, and the <i>Comet</i>
began to sink.</p>

<p>“He’s torn a hole in our gas bag! We’re
going down!” yelled Jerry, as he leaped toward
the motor room. “Ned—Bob! Start the vapor
machine or we’ll crash to earth!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>SUSPICIOUS CONVERSATION</small></h2>


<p>There was intense excitement aboard the
<i>Comet</i>. So, for that matter, was there also on
the <i>Winner</i>, for at first Noddy and Bill did not
know but that their own craft had been damaged.
But, as they kept on rising, in response to the uptilted
rudder, Noddy was sure they were all right.
He quickly brought his craft up on a level keel,
and then swept around in a big circle to see what
was happening to the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Lively, boys!” cried Jerry. “Turn on the
machine at full speed, Ned, and that will check
us until we can get under way,” for they were
motionless when the accident occurred.</p>

<p>Ned had acted the instant he heard Jerry’s call,
and now a double quantity of the lifting gas was
pouring into the ripped bag.</p>

<p>Though the rent was a large one, the bag was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
made in a number of compartments, so that only
the two that were ripped open by the <i>Winner</i>
lost their vapor. The others were more fully
distended and served to check the downward rush
of the airship.</p>

<p>After a sickening plunge the <i>Comet</i> gradually
slowed up in her descent, and when within a few
hundred feet of the earth she glided ahead as an
aeroplane, her propellers forcing her onward.</p>

<p>But there was not chance enough to get up
much momentum, and, as they ran into an adverse
current of air, which continued to force
them earthward, and, as for some reason the
main motor was not working well, Jerry concluded
to make a full descent, so he could see
what damage had been done, and then rise again.</p>

<p>“Stand by to make a landing!” he called to his
chums; and a moment later the <i>Comet</i> came to
rest on the level green meadow while above her
the <i>Winner</i> winged her flight through the air.</p>

<p>“Well, wouldn’t that jar you!” exclaimed Ned
in great disgust.</p>

<p>“I should say so,” remarked Bob. “It’s just
like Noddy Nixon’s freshness. He ought to
learn how to run an aeroplane in the kindergarten
class before he comes out with the high school
boys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll make him pay for our damaged bag!” declared
Jerry firmly. “He ought to have known
better than to try that stunt. I’ll make him soak
up for it all right.”</p>

<p>The boys were standing beside their craft, and
Jerry was peering upward trying to discover the
extent of the tear in the gas bag.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it was all my fault,” said Andy
Rush, more quietly than he usually spoke. “If
I hadn’t challenged Noddy the way I did it might
not have happened.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you didn’t mean anything,” consoled
Ned. “Besides, Noddy might have done it anyhow.
Even if you did call to him he ought to
have known better than to try to cross over us
so close. I guess Bill Berry put him up to it.
Don’t worry Andy. Is it very bad, Jerry?”</p>

<p>The tall lad had climbed up in the rigging that
held the bag, and was critically examining it.</p>

<p>“Two of the compartments are all ripped to
pieces, and there’s a small tear in a third one,”
Jerry reported. “We’ll have to put on big
patches. I’ll make Noddy pay for this.”</p>

<p>“Can we get home?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Of course. You forget that as an aeroplane
we’re as good as ever,” responded Ned. “Say,
look at Noddy though, he’s flying high.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, the bully and his crony were making a
successful flight, and were now but a mere speck
in the sky.</p>

<p>“He’s doing better than I ever expected he
would,” remarked Jerry. “I hope he steers clear
of us after this. He needs half the upper region
to navigate in. If he goes to the Colton meet
we won’t enter any of the events he’s in.”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” exclaimed Ned earnestly.</p>

<p>There was nothing that could be done toward
repairing the <i>Comet</i> now, so, after letting all the
gas out of the bag, and seeing to the defect in the
main motor, which was in the ignition system, the
boys made ready to fly home as an aeroplane.</p>

<p>The propellers were started, and the motorship
skimmed over the meadow. It was rather an
uneven course, and the boys were pretty well
jolted up, but they managed to acquire enough
speed to lift their craft, and once in the air the
machine soared high. In ten minutes they were
in front of the hangar, and the <i>Comet</i> had been
wheeled inside.</p>

<p>“Are you really going to tackle Noddy about
paying for the damage?” asked Ned, as he walked
beside Jerry toward the latter’s house.</p>

<p>“I sure am! I’m going over there to-night, and
if he won’t pay I’ll see his father. It’s time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
bully found out that he can’t have everything his
own way.”</p>

<p>“Want Bob or me to come along?”</p>

<p>“No, I think I can do better alone, thanks. If
we all go we might get into a quarrel. I’ll tackle
him alone.”</p>

<p>In accordance with his plan, Jerry set off that
evening, leaving Professor Snodgrass at home
classifying some of the specimens he had caught
that day. There were many lights in the Nixon
mansion, which was set in the midst of extensive
grounds, for Mr. Nixon was quite wealthy.</p>

<p>“Looks as if they had company,” mused Jerry.
“I guess I’ll find Noddy home. He always is
if there’s any eating going on—like Bob,” and he
smiled in the darkness.</p>

<p>But Noddy was not at home—at least, that is
what the maid said who answered Jerry’s ring.
The tall lad was right in his surmise that something
was going on at the Nixon home, for he
could see many guests in the parlors, and he caught
the strains of music.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Nixon in?” he asked, determined to
make an appeal to Noddy’s father.</p>

<p>“He is, but he’s very busy. I doubt if he’ll see
you,” was the reply, and, after thinking it over
Jerry concluded that it was an inopportune time
to make his demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll see him to-morrow,” he said as he turned
away.</p>

<p>The shed where Noddy kept his aeroplane was
some distance from the house, but on the same
street, for Mr. Nixon owned a large piece of property
adjoining his residence. It was in front of
this shed that Jerry found himself a few minutes
later.</p>

<p>He gazed up at the big, dark building, and his
thoughts were not very pleasant as he recalled the
damage the bully had done to the <i>Comet</i> that
afternoon.</p>

<p>“I wonder where Noddy is?” mused the tall
lad. “He and Bill are probably off somewhere
together. I wonder if he could be in here?”</p>

<p>Jerry paused. There was no light visible in the
shed, and our hero was about to pass on, when
something—some impulse he could not define,—caused
him to turn and advance a little way inside
the fence that surrounded the building. The gate
was open.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! They can’t be in there,” thought
Jerry. “I might as well go home.”</p>

<p>But at that instant there came to his ears the
sound of voices in cautious conversation. He listened
intently.</p>

<p>“I tell you it’s too risky,” he heard some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
say, and in a moment he knew it was the tones
of Bill Berry.</p>

<p>“Oh get out! You’re afraid!” retorted Noddy
Nixon. “We can easily do it, and get safely
away.”</p>

<p>“But the police?” objected Bill.</p>

<p>“Bah! They’ll never suspect that we’re going
to do anything like that. And, even if they do
we’ll have the job done and get away before they
know anything about it. I tell you it’s perfectly
safe. Isn’t it worth trying for?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I s’pose it is—but if we’re nabbed?”</p>

<p>“We won’t be I tell you,” and Noddy seemed
half angry. “Most of the police will be at the
Colton meet, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can handle the machine well
enough?” asked Bill.</p>

<p>“I know I can. Look what I did to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did cut it pretty fine,” admitted Bill.</p>

<p>“And I guess I gave those fellows a scare they
won’t soon forget!” chuckled Noddy.</p>

<p>Jerry clenched his hands in anger. But he was
not yet ready to make his presence known.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll go in with me on it?” asked
Noddy, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose so. If we’re caught it can’t
be——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll not get caught!” declared Noddy again.
“The Harmolet police are too sleepy for anything
like that to happen. There’ll be a big surprise
when they wake up in the morning and find it
gone,” and he chuckled again.</p>

<p>Then the voices died away, and it seemed as if
the two cronies had gone inside the shed, outside
of which they had evidently been standing in the
darkness when Jerry overheard their conversation.</p>

<p>The tall lad hesitated a moment, uncertain
what to do. Then he murmured:</p>

<p>“I guess I won’t say anything to Noddy to-night.
I’ll wait and see what sort of a game he’s
up to. It sounds suspicious to me.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>OFF TO THE MEET</small></h2>


<p>“What do you reckon they were talking
about?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Are you sure it was Noddy and Bill?” inquired
Bob.</p>

<p>The two were questioning their chum Jerry the
day following the accident to the <i>Comet</i>, when the
tall lad had reported to them the result of his visit
to Noddy’s house.</p>

<p>“I’m as sure it was Noddy and Bill, as that I’m
talking to you and Ned this minute, Bob. But
as to what they were talking about I give up. I’ve
been thinking of it all night, but I can’t hit it,”
answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“Some mischief I’ll wager,” came from Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can be sure of that,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“One thing seems to be certain,” went on the
tall lad, “and that is they’re going to the Colton
meet. I wish they weren’t, since we’ve entered
our machine there. But there’s no help for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is a free country,” declared the stout lad.
“They can do as they please, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we’re going to the meet it’s time we
did something to the <i>Comet</i>,” suggested the merchant’s
son. “What about the rips in the gas bag,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“We’ll get right at them. I’ve got out the
stuff to mend the tears. I’ll start you and Bob on
that, and I’ll make another try to see Noddy.
I’m going to make him pay up if it’s possible.”</p>

<p>A little later, having seen that his two chums
were putting the patches on the gas bag the right
way, Jerry again went to the Nixon house. A
sleepy-eyed maid answered the bell, yawning,
though it was after ten o’clock. Evidently the
company had stayed late the night before.</p>

<p>“Master Noddy is not in,” she replied in response
to Jerry’s inquiry. “He’s out of town,
and I don’t know when he will be back.”</p>

<p>“Out of town?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to some balloon show I heard him tell his
father. Mr. Nixon is in, if you’d like to see
him.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the tall lad. “Did
Noddy take his airship with him?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s being packed up now. Some men are
out in the shed boxing it up. It’s going out to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
balloon show I believe. Is there any word you’d
like to leave,” she asked, as she saw Jerry turn
to go.</p>

<p>Jerry thought there was none, and hurrying to
the shed where Bob and Ned were working away
over the <i>Comet</i>, he told his chums the news.</p>

<p>“Noddy means business all right,” declared
Ned, pausing with a cement pot in one hand, while
with the other he tried to rub off a daub of tar on
his nose.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s after our scalp,” suggested Bob.
“But I guess we can do stunts with the <i>Comet</i> that
he wouldn’t dare dream of.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” assented Jerry. “Well, as long as he’s
gone I’ll have to defer collecting damages. Now
we’ll get busy.”</p>

<p>For more than a week our heroes spent most
of their time in the aeroplane shed. The gas bag
was repaired, and made stronger than ever, the
motor was overhauled, a general cleaning of the
machinery took place, a new railing was put
around the after platform, and the air craft was
put in condition to take part in a distance race, a
high flight, or to do startling evolutions about the
aviation field.</p>

<p>They had formally entered the <i>Comet</i> in the
hundreds miles’ race which was to take place in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
ten-mile circuit about the aviation grounds, and
they had also entered in the high-flying event.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when Jerry went to the post-office,
he received a letter from the secretary of
the meet, enclosing an entrant’s certificate, and
also a list showing those who would take part in
the various events.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to compete against Noddy in
both big races—distance and height,” said Jerry
dubiously to his two chums.</p>

<p>“Really?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure, here’s his name, and he’s entered Bill
Berry as a passenger.”</p>

<p>“He’s got nerve,” declared Bob. “Well, we’ll
beat him all right. But I would like to know what
game he and Bill are after in Harmolet.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” agreed Jerry. “But say, fellows,
we haven’t any too much time. We ought to give
the <i>Comet</i> one good try-out, and then take her
apart and ship her to the meet.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with going to the meet <em>in</em>
her?” asked Ned. “We can easily do it, and it
will save time and work.”</p>

<p>“The only thing is we might have an accident
on the way, and then we’d be out of it, if we
couldn’t get the repairs done in time,” objected
Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, take a chance,” urged the merchant’s son;
and so it was decided.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was given a final trial flight the next
day, and the boys, in company with Professor
Snodgrass, went through some intricate evolutions,
as well as testing the speed of the motorship on a
straight-away course.</p>

<p>They sailed up to a dizzy height, came down
in spirals, volplaned to earth as an aeroplane with
the gas entirely out of the bag, floated lazily in the
air as a balloon, and went after a height record.
The last they did not accomplish, for they had
only gotten up about three miles when they ran
into a violent snowstorm, and Jerry, not wanting
to take any chances with the time of the meet so
near at hand, made a quick descent.</p>

<p>“We’ve gone higher on other occasions,” he
said to his chums, “and we know we can do it, so
there’s no use taking too many risks. Otherwise
the <i>Comet</i> never did better.”</p>

<p>“And if we don’t win at least two prizes I’ll
eat my hat,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>“And about everything else on board too, I suspect,
Chunky,” remarked Ned, with a grin.</p>

<p>While the professor was interested in the working
of the motorship, and proud of the ability of
his young friends, he spent more time looking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
insects in the upper air, than in watching the intricate
evolutions.</p>

<p>“And how soon after the meet will you start
for the West?” he inquired anxiously, when they
had wheeled the <i>Comet</i> into the shed.</p>

<p>“Oh, in a few days,” promised Jerry. “I believe
he cares more about that flying frog than he
does about us winning a prize,” confided the tall
lad to his chums.</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>The final preparations were made. Plenty of
provisions were put aboard, there was enough
gasolene for a long flight, and materials for making
the lifting gas had been stored away. The
<i>Comet</i> was ready for the flight to Colton.</p>

<p>“Well, we might as well get aboard,” remarked
Jerry the day of the start, after he and his chums
had looked over every bolt, nut, lever, cam, valve,
gear and guy-wire. “We can take our time getting
there.”</p>

<p>“Let her go!” cried Bob. “I’ve got everything
ready for a meal above the clouds.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” murmured Ned. “No danger
of you forgetting anything in <em>that</em> line.”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass was busy mending a hole
in his butterfly net. Jerry was in the pilot house,
while Ned and Bob were in the engine room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“All ready?” inquired the tall lad.</p>

<p>“All ready,” replied Ned, with a final look at
the machinery.</p>

<p>“Then here we go!”</p>

<p>Jerry pulled the starting lever, just as Andy
Rush ran into the enclosure.</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” called the little lad. “Good luck!
Off you go! Up in the air! Whizz around!
Turn over—right side up with care—off again—high
as Gilroy’s kite—win the prize—whoop-ee!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad that’s over,” murmured Jerry
with a smile.</p>

<p>Across the level space went the <i>Comet</i> with a
whizz and a roar. The next minute it had
mounted upward, and the motor boys were on the
wing.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>NEWS OF BROWN AND BLACK</small></h2>


<p>“Well, it seems like old times,” remarked
Ned as he took an easy chair in the living room,
back of the pilot house, and watched Jerry manipulating
the various wheels and levers, as the big
motorship mounted upward on a long slant.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re under way again,” agreed the tall
lad. “I wonder what will happen to us this
trip?”</p>

<p>“What makes you think anything will happen?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Well it generally does, Chunky. Either we
run over a spotted calf, or rip a cornice off a barn,
or have a run-in with Noddy Nixon. Oh, there’ll
be something doing on this trip before it’s over,
mark my words.”</p>

<p>“I hope we’re done with mix-ups and Noddy
Nixon,” came from Ned. “More likely we’ll
have one with those queer fellows we met at Freedon—Black
and Green.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Black and Brown you mean,” broke in Jerry.
“What’s the matter with you; are you color
blind?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, it was Black and Brown,” assented
the merchant’s son. “Well, I hope if we
do meet them, that they turn out to be ‘white.’”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Bob. “That’s a joke—‘white!’
Oh my!”</p>

<p>“Glad <em>you</em> aren’t color blind, and can see it,”
said Jerry with a smile. “But what makes you
think we’ll meet them, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just a notion; that’s all. But say,
we’re up high enough. Set the automatic steering
gear, and take it easy, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Guess I will,” assented the tall youth.
“There’s no use wasting gas,” for in addition to
mounting upward by means of the aeroplanes the
lifting vapor was also in use.</p>

<p>For several hours our friends sailed slowly
along, high above the earth. They were not running
their machine to the limit of speed, for
though they could readily have made a quick trip
to Colton, the place of the meet, they preferred to
take it easy, and avoid chances of a breakdown.</p>

<p>Promptly at noon—perhaps a little in advance
of that hour—Bob announced dinner, which he
had been some time in preparing. His chums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
said it did him credit, and the manner in which
they ate was additional testimony. Even Professor
Snodgrass, who managed to tear himself away
from his specimens long enough to come to the
table, condescended to pass his plate for some
more of the fried chicken. Bob had installed a
small ice chest on the <i>Comet</i>, and victuals could
be kept cold by means of ammonia vapors, so it
was possible to serve fresh meats.</p>

<p>“We ought to be there pretty soon now,” observed
Jerry, toward the close of the day. “I
figure we’ll just about get to Colton before dark.”</p>

<p>“You engaged a hangar for us, didn’t you?”
inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure. The secretary of the aeronautic association
wrote me that he had picked out for us one
of the best on the grounds. It’s of heavy canvas
over a wooden frame. They didn’t have time to
put up all wooden ones.”</p>

<p>“Well, better speed up a little,” suggested Bob.
“We don’t want to drop down on a strange
ground after dusk. Hit it up a little, Jerry.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was soon scudding along at a faster
clip, when suddenly a little cry from Ned, who
was in the pilot house brought Bob and Jerry to
his side on the run.</p>

<p>“There’s the place!” he cried, pointing ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>They could see a broad level plateau on which
could be made out many tents and hangars, gay
with flags and bunting, while here and there the
graceful biplanes or monoplanes were interspersed
with the more bulky dirigible balloons.</p>

<p>“Say, there’s a lot of ’em all right!” exclaimed
Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it’s going to be a good meet,”
assented Jerry.</p>

<p>“You better make the landing,” interposed Ned,
motioning for the tall lad to take the steering
wheel. “You’re more used to it than I am, and
we want to make a good impression.”</p>

<p>“You fellows can do it as well as I,” declared
Jerry. “The only thing is that you lack confidence.
You must get used to it. However, I’ll
take her down this time.”</p>

<p>He turned on a little more power and then,
shutting off the gas he picked out an unoccupied
spot, and volplaned to earth with great skill, evoking
applause from a crowd of aeronauts and spectators
who crowded out to witness the arrival of
a new machine.</p>

<p>“Here safe,” remarked Ned as he prepared to
descend from the deck of the motorship.</p>

<p>“Look around and see if you can pick out
Noddy’s craft,” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>“Or that of Brown and Black,” added Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>But a first glance about the grounds did not
disclose the biplanes either of the bully, or the two
odd men, and Jerry and his chums could have instantly
discerned them had they been in sight, for
they were experts in the matter of identifying aircraft.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you! Your hangar is right over
this way, boys!” exclaimed a hearty voice, and
looking up Jerry and his chums saw a small,
pleasant-faced man making his way through the
crowd toward them. “I’m Mr. Nichols, secretary
of the meet,” he went on. “We’re all ready
for you. My! That’s a great machine you
have!” and between shaking hands with our
friends and the professor he gazed admiringly at
the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>Many willing hands aided the boys in rolling
their machine over to the big canvas shed that
had been set apart for their use. They had
landed not far from it. Of course Professor
Snodgrass had disappeared the instant earth was
reached, but the boys saw him some distance off,
eagerly peering about for specimens.</p>

<p>“He’s at home all right,” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>Our friends found their hangar well furnished
for their use. They did not need to take advantage
of the cots and cooking arrangements that
had been put in, for their machine was as good as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a hotel to them. But not every airship was thus
completely fitted up.</p>

<p>“Well I’ll leave you for a while,” said Mr.
Nichols at length, when he had explained to the
boys some of the details of the meet which was
to open officially in two days. “I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way,” began Jerry, “have you another
craft here from our city—Cresville?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe there is an entrant from there,”
replied the secretary. “It’s a big biplane—a very
good craft too. Run by a fellow named Dixon,
I think.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it Nixon?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“You’re right—I believe it is.”</p>

<p>“Is he here now?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Well he was, but if I’m not mistaken I believe
he and his partner—a Mr. Apple I think it
is——”</p>

<p>“I guess you mean Berry,” interposed Bob.</p>

<p>“You’re right, it is Berry. I am poor at remembering
names. Nixon and Berry went out
for a spin. They just got their machine together
to-day.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad we didn’t take ours apart,” spoke
up Ned. “We saved a lot of time.”</p>

<p>“Have you any entrants named Brown or
Black?” went on Jerry, who was somewhat
anxious for news of the two strange men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hum! Brown and Black. Oh, yes, I remember
now. They were here, with their
machine, too, a big biplane named the <i>Silver
Star</i>.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” exclaimed Ned eagerly.</p>

<p>“But they left,” went on the secretary. “They
refused to comply with the rules regarding the
number of flights, and left in a huff. I don’t much
care, as I didn’t like their appearance. But I’m
glad you boys are here. You’ll be a sort of drawing-card,
as you have quite a reputation in aviation
circles.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” said Jerry with a laugh, as the
genial secretary withdrew.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got Noddy to reckon with, but not
the others,” remarked Ned, as they proceeded to
wash up for supper, over which Bob was already
busy in the galley.</p>

<p>“Yes, and Noddy’s enough trouble at a time,”
spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>Ned had lathered himself well and was about to
indulge in the luxury of a splashing in the basin,
when some shouts outside caused Jerry, who was
getting rid of his coat and vest, to rush from the
hangar.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager it’s the professor in trouble over
his bugs again,” ventured the merchant’s son.</p>

<p>“No it isn’t, it’s a biplane coming down,” called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
back Jerry. “It’s Noddy Nixon, too! And say,
he’s lost control of it! He almost turned turtle
then!”</p>

<p>Bob and Ned rushed outside the tent. In the
gathering dusk they looked up to where Jerry
pointed and saw a big biplane coming down with
a rush, while two frightened figures clung to the
seats, one endeavoring to bring up the head planes
and avoid smashing to earth.</p>

<p>“They’re in a bad way!” murmured Jerry.
“Their engine must have stopped and they tried
to volplane down. But their rudders won’t work
and——”</p>

<p>“They’re going to smash as sure as fate!” burst
out Ned. “I guess it’s all up with Noddy Nixon
and Bill Berry!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>WINNING A PRIZE</small></h2>


<p>Indeed it did seem that nothing could save
Noddy and Bill. With the speed of the wind, and
like a bird with a broken wing, their aeroplane
was shooting downward. The two could be seen,
even in the gathering dusk, to be working
desperately to throw up the head planes or the
lifting rudder. If this could be done the biplane
would shoot upward on a slant, and its swift
downward flight would be checked.</p>

<p>“His rudder lines must be jammed,” murmured
Jerry in a low voice.</p>

<p>There were expressions of horror from the
crowd. The aeroplane was now within a hundred
feet of the ground.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a flutter of white at the
prow, a flash of a canvas plane, and the nose of the
craft appeared to tilt upward.</p>

<p>“He’s done it!” cried Ned. “He’s got the
rudder to work! Now he can save himself!”</p>

<p>“If it isn’t too late,” added Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>But Noddy proved himself to have some pluck,
and he showed not a little knowledge of how to
manage his machine. Quickly throwing up the
forward plane, he sent his craft along on a slightly
upward slant. This checked it almost like a
brake, and, when he had considerably reduced the
momentum, he shifted the rudder lines, and once
more headed for the earth.</p>

<p>There was a cheer from the crowd, and our
friends could not help joining in it, even though
they had no love for Noddy or Bill.</p>

<p>“He’s all right now, if he keeps control of it,”
spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>Whether Noddy did not keep control of it, or
whether the experience through which he had just
passed shook his nerves was not manifest, but as
a matter of fact he came down to the ground on
too short a slant, and without checking enough of
his speed.</p>

<p>There was a splintering sound, a breaking of
metal, and the bicycle wheels of the aeroplane
collapsed under the sudden shock. Noddy and
Bill were thrown out, but not hurt beyond a severe
shaking up. Willing hands assisted them to rise.</p>

<p>“You had a lucky escape,” commented one man.</p>

<p>“I should say yes,” chimed in another. “I
thought it was all up with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, we’re tough; eh, Bill?” cried Noddy with
a boastful laugh. “I knew we’d come out all
right. The tilting rudder got jammed. But I
guess our machine is badly smashed.”</p>

<p>“No, a new set of wheels and a couple of
springs is all it needs,” decided one of the
aeronauts after an inspection. “There are a lot
of spare parts here. You can get fixed up in time
for the race.”</p>

<p>“He’s got more pluck than I gave him credit
for,” remarked Bob, as he and his chums went
back to their quarters and proceeded to get supper.</p>

<p>There were busy times next day for all concerned
in the meet. Officials were making the final
arrangements for handling the crowds they expected;
exhibitors and those who expected to take
part in the flights and races were “tuning up”
their motors, or making repairs or changes in their
machines. Some of the earlier comers were taking
short flights, and one daring Frenchman, in a
tiny machine, was circling high in the air, trying
for a record.</p>

<p>Our heroes found a few changes necessary to
make to their craft, and they were so busy over
them that they paid little attention to what was
going on outside. In the afternoon Ned, who had
gone to the secretary to secure some information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
concerning the time of certain races, reported that
Noddy’s machine had been repaired and that the
bully and Bill were going to make another flight.</p>

<p>“How’d he get another set of wheels so soon?”
asked Jerry, pausing with a small bicycle wrench
in his hand. He had been tightening some of the
turnbuckles of the guy wires.</p>

<p>“Oh there was a set here that some one left or
didn’t want and some extra tires,” replied the
merchant’s son. “Say, you ought to see them.
They’re almost as big as automobile wheels, with
thick, heavy tires on them, and those raised, right-angle,
anti-skid projections on the rubber. They
make a track in the mud like a lot of chickens.”</p>

<p>“What made Noddy put on such heavy tires?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Guess he hadn’t any choice,” answered Ned.
“He’s going to take part in the hundred mile race
to-morrow, and he wants to be ready, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I hope we win that race,” remarked Jerry
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Why there isn’t much money in it,” went on
Ned. “There’s twenty-five hundred dollars for
the machine that makes the best height record. I
should think you’d care more about that. It’s
only a thousand and the gold cup for the winner
of the hundred mile race.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know it, but it’s the cup I want for a
trophy,” said Jerry. “We don’t really need the
money, but I like the glory. Besides, going after
a height record is rather monotonous, just circling
about in a spiral. Of course it’s sensational for
the crowd to watch, and that’s why the management
offer a big money prize for it. But the best
test of an aeroplane is in a long distance flight.
I hope we win.”</p>

<p>Of course Ned and Bob did also, though there
was a difference of opinion as to which race would
confer the greater honor if won.</p>

<p>There were many machines in flight now, in
preparation for the next day. There were a number
of biplanes, including Noddy Nixon’s <i>Winner</i>,
several monoplanes, one triplane, three dirigible
balloons, and one machine something like that of
our heroes, a combination balloon and aeroplane.
But it was not as large nor as powerful as the
<i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>The air was filled with the snapping, crackling
sounds of motors being tried, and the smell of
gasolene was all over. There was a babel of
tongues, French, German, Italian and Japanese,
for one aviator of the latter nation was going to
try for a prize.</p>

<p>Here one would see an aviator and his assistants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
mending a torn plane, or fixing a rudder.
Over at the other side of the grounds one of the
birdmen was testing the thrust of his machine’s
propellers by means of a spring scale. Another
was trying to discover a defect in his ignition system,
and others were oiling, fixing or warming up
their motors. Flags and banners fluttered from
tents and hangars, officials were hurrying to and
fro, and some excited and anxious aviators were
seeking missing parts which had been shipped to
them but which had not arrived.</p>

<p>“Lots doing,” commented Bob, as he and his
chums got ready to go up in their machine.</p>

<p>“Plenty,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s almost like a circus,” was Ned’s opinion,
“and we’re part of the show.”</p>

<p>“Well, get aboard and we’ll start,” counseled
Jerry. “We’ll see if we can get up any speed.”</p>

<p>“That’s a great machine you’ve got there,”
complimented the busy secretary as he hurried
past. “Will you give some exhibitions flights
after the regular events?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” promised Jerry.</p>

<p>Our heroes had no reason to complain of the
manner in which their craft behaved. They went
up to a good height and circled about in graceful
curves. Then, having warmed up the motor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Jerry, who had been picked by his chums to guide
the <i>Comet</i> in the race the next day, sent her around
the ten mile course.</p>

<p>Faster and faster flew the big machine until
even the tall steersman, exacting as he was, could
not help admitting that he was satisfied.</p>

<p>“She’ll do,” he said, as he coasted toward the
earth. “We’ll make the flight of our lives to-morrow,
and——”</p>

<p>“Win!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Exactly!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>Swiftly the time went by, until at last came the
hour for the great hundred mile race. The immense
grand stand was filled with an eager anxious
throng, and thousands equally eager and anxious
stood about the big field, well out of way of the air
machines. The course of ten miles was marked
by anchored balloons, painted white, which were
easily visible across the wide valley where the meet
took place.</p>

<p>Noddy Nixon had his machine out at the starting
line. It had been patched up, and, as Ned had
remarked the wheels seemed too big for it. In
all there were seven starters besides the <i>Comet</i>,
and contestants included the <i>Winner</i>, a triplane,
an Antoinette, a Bleriot monoplane and Wright,
Curtiss and Farman biplanes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>It was to be a “flying” start. That is the contestants
would get in motion at the sound of a
gun, would rise as best they could, and approach
an imaginary line in the air, above the white balloon
marking the beginning of the course. Then
the race would be to the swiftest machine.</p>

<p>There was a last inspection of the engines and
air craft, a hurried testing of the propellers, and
then, in answer to a question from the secretary,
the contestants said that they were ready.</p>

<p>Bang! went the pistol. The report was followed
by a series of deafening explosions as the
motors started. Our three heroes were among
the first to get under way, and they quickly
mounted to a good height. The others followed.
All approached the first anchored balloon in a
bunch and a moment later the race was on.</p>

<p>“Now for a long and steady grind,” said Bob,
as he and Ned, oil cans in hand, went to the motor
room. Jerry was in the steering tower.</p>

<p>“Look what’s coming!” cried Bob, pausing in
the act of lubricating a bearing. “The Antoinette
is going to pass us!”</p>

<p>“Let her,” answered Jerry easily. “He hasn’t
enough gasolene to last out, I don’t believe, if she
burns it up that way.”</p>

<p>“And here comes Noddy in the <i>Winner</i>,” added
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” advised the tall lad. “The
race has only begun.”</p>

<p>Noddy and Bill, in their craft shot up on even
terms with our friends, and then, as though to
show what he could do, Noddy dropped back
again.</p>

<p>The big triplane was having difficulties, and it
had not covered more than three-quarters of the
way around the first circle of the course before it
dropped out and went back to earth, engine
troubles being responsible. The other machines
remained in the race, however, and were about on
even terms. Now one would be ahead, and then
another. The monoplane took the lead after the
first ten miles, and kept it for two rounds. Then
the engine suddenly ceased working and the unlucky
operator had to volplane to earth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jerry and his chums had gone
steadily on. The tall lad had gradually increased
the speed of the engine, as he found it working
well, and now they were making about forty miles
an hour. This would soon be almost doubled
when the race was nearer an end.</p>

<p>The Farman, Curtiss and Wright machines
were about on a line with the <i>Comet</i>, and the
<i>Winner</i> was a little to the rear.</p>

<p>“I guess those big tires are too much for
Noddy,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to speed up, Jerry?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it’s about time.”</p>

<p>The race was half over when Jerry opened the
gasolene throttle wider. At once the <i>Comet</i> shot
well to the fore. As if only waiting for this the
others followed suit, all save the Antoinette, which
had to drop out. This left five contestants.</p>

<p>“Now the real race begins,” remarked Jerry
grimly, as he took a firmer grasp of the steering
wheel.</p>

<p>“And here comes Noddy,” added Ned.</p>

<p>Indeed the race was now on in earnest. Faster
and faster flew the airships, their motors crackling
and spluttering in a deafening manner. They
were not flying very high, for it was desired to
give the spectators a good view of the spectacular
contest.</p>

<p>“They’re creeping up,” warned Bob, as he saw
the other four machines edging closer and closer.</p>

<p>“Let them,” said Jerry. “I’ve got some reserve
power yet, and I think they’re about all in.”</p>

<p>Ned looked at the speed gage.</p>

<p>“Ninety miles an hour!” he gasped. “We’ll
finish in a few minutes more.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I hope to do,” replied the tall
lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken than there sounded behind
them an ominous cracking sound. In alarm
our heroes looked to the wings of their craft, but
they were all right.</p>

<p>“It’s the Curtiss,” cried Ned. “One of the
wing tips had gone to smash.”</p>

<p>This was so. Too sudden a strain had put it
out of commission. Like a disabled bird the
biplane was wobbling uncertainly in the air. The
next moment it shot toward earth, and came down
with a crash.</p>

<p>Our heroes turned white, for well they knew the
terrible result of such a fall. But they could not
stop. On and on they went, faster and faster.
Yet, as they circled the course on the last ten miles
they saw Noddy and the Farman machine creeping
up on them.</p>

<p>Now Noddy was almost on even terms, and so
close that the evil, grinning faces of himself and
Bill Berry could easily be seen.</p>

<p>“Beat him, Jerry! Beat him!” begged Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, don’t let him get ahead!” pleaded Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry did not answer, but his lips parted in a
grim smile, and his hand grasped the steering
wheel more firmly while with his foot he pressed
open still wider the accelerator throttle.</p>

<p>The Wright and Farman machines were now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
almost wing and wing with Noddy’s craft, which
hung just at the flank of the <i>Comet</i>. The white
balloon, marking the finish was but three miles
ahead. They would be up to it in about two minutes
at the fearful speed they had now attained.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a rush, the <i>Winner</i> forged
ahead of the other two contestants and took her
place on even terms with the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Ned. “Noddy may foul
us!”</p>

<p>Jerry nodded. He threw over the throttle to
the end notch. The <i>Comet</i> shot ahead like a fox
making a last desperate spurt to get away from
the dogs. The finish balloon was but a few hundred
feet farther on.</p>

<p>Suddenly the motor of the <i>Comet</i> ceased working.
The silence was more ominous than a terrific
explosion could have been.</p>

<p>“We’re done for!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s all up!” predicted Bob.</p>

<p>“No!” fairly shouted Jerry. “We’ll volplane
the rest of the way!”</p>

<p>He tilted the deflecting lever. Instantly the
nose of the <i>Comet</i> pointed earthward. There was
a shout of dismay from the spectators, and a yell
of triumph from Noddy Nixon.</p>

<p>But he had reckoned without his host. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the terrific speed at which she had been running
to urge her on, and aided by the force of gravitation
and her momentum, the <i>Comet</i> shot forward.
Then, when still a good distance from the earth
Jerry sent her up on a sharp slant.</p>

<p>Forward she shot, like an arrow from the bow,
and an instant later, with her engine “dead” she
crossed the line a winner, two lengths in advance
of the Nixon machine, which was second.</p>

<p>“Wow! We did it!” cried Bob in delight.</p>

<p>“By the great horn spoon, yes!” yelled Ned.
“Jerry, you’re a wonder!”</p>

<p>Jerry said nothing. He was now guiding the
<i>Comet</i> safely to earth by the maneuver known as
“volplaning.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>A RISKY CLIMB</small></h2>


<p>“That race wasn’t won fair!”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Noddy, we’ll protest it!” This
from Bill Berry, who with his crony had hurried
to the office of the secretary after alighting from
the <i>Winner</i>.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the official, looking from
Noddy to our three friends who, in response to
the request, had come up to headquarters to receive
the prizes they had so pluckily won.</p>

<p>“I say that race wasn’t won fair!” insisted the
bully. “The engine of the <i>Comet</i> stopped and
they coasted over the line. That’s not right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think it is,” replied the secretary gently.
“You read the articles of agreement which you
signed. They are alike for all contestants. The
first machine to cross the line wins, engine or no
engine.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s not fair!” grumbled Noddy.</p>

<p>“Course it ain’t!” declared Bill. “We wouldn’t
have raced if we’d known that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, get out!” exclaimed the operator of the
Wright machine who had finished a close second
to Noddy. “You make me tired. If your engine
had stopped you’d have tried to win the same
way. Get out! Jerry Hopkins and his chums
won the race fair, and I never saw a more plucky
finish! I’m proud to shake hands with you,” and
he extended his palm to the tall lad.</p>

<p>“It gives me pleasure,” spoke the secretary,
“to hand you this trophy, and the thousand dollars,
and to congratulate you boys on your success,”
and he passed over the gold loving cup, and
a crisp thousand dollar bill.</p>

<p>“Speech! Speech!” came the cry from the crowd
that had gathered; but Jerry, blushing furiously
made his way through the press of people, followed
by Ned and Bob, and sought seclusion in
the hangar. But the mob was not to be denied
and followed there, to gaze at the successful aviators.
They insisted so on being talked to that, to
get rid of them, Jerry did make a few remarks,
thanking them for their appreciation, and telling
something of how the race was run.</p>

<p>As for Noddy, like a bear with a sore head, he
and Bill sulked in their tent, grumbling at the action
of the officials in awarding the race to our
heroes. But no one paid much attention to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Jerry and his chums were much relieved to learn
that of the two operators on the Curtiss biplane,
which fell to the earth, one was only severely
bruised, while the other sustained a broken arm.
Their escape from death was almost miraculous.</p>

<p>“What was the matter with our motor that it
stopped?” asked Ned, looking at the <i>Comet</i> which
had been wheeled into the big tent.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, we’ll make an examination,”
replied Jerry, who was gazing at the gold loving
cup. “Do you know, fellows I’m prouder of this
than some of the other trophies we’ve won, and we
have quite a few.”</p>

<p>“What did you do with the thousand dollar
bill?” asked Bob with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s somewhere around,” and Jerry pulled
it, all crumpled up, from his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so much of this cup?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Because we’ve won it against some of the best
birdmen in the world, and against some of the
speediest machines. You must remember that
our craft isn’t primarily a racer. The <i>Comet</i> is
more like a touring auto—built for pleasure, and
since we put on the hydroplanes it’s considerably
heavier than it was. This is the first race we’ve
won since we attached them, and it goes to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
that we’ve got a fine and powerful motor. That’s
why I’m so proud of this cup.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to try for the elevation
prize?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure, but as I said I prefer distance racing.
Now we’ll look to see what the trouble was.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll take care of this thousand-spot,”
added Ned, as he carefully put the bill in his
pocketbook. “You’d use it to clean a brass pipe
with, Jerry.”</p>

<p>It was found that a broken wire in the ignition
system was responsible for the stopping of the
motor, and the defect was soon remedied. While
the boys were at this, a message came from the
secretary, asking them if they would not oblige
the big crowd by doing some special stunts late
that afternoon, following the regular events.
These latter included some monoplane flights, and
some qualifying ascensions by men who wanted to
get a pilot’s license.</p>

<p>“Shall we do it?” asked Jerry of his chums.</p>

<p>“Might as well,” replied Ned, and word to that
effect was sent to the secretary.</p>

<p>“We ought to take the professor along if we’re
going to give an exhibition,” remarked Bob a little
later. “The <i>Comet</i> goes better with four
aboard, especially when we’re doing stunts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jerry. “I wonder
where he is? I haven’t seen him since early
morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s off after bugs, you can depend on it,”
declared Ned.</p>

<p>They were engaged in cleaning and oiling the
motor, in anticipation of the flight they were to
make later in the day, when a series of shouts outside
their big tent caused them to stare at each
other in surprise and some apprehension.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe some one else is falling,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry hurried out, and immediately called to
his chums:</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong over at Noddy’s
hangar. Maybe he and Bill are having a fight.”</p>

<p>It needed only such a mention as that to bring
Ned and Bob out on the run. They looked to
where Jerry pointed and saw a big throng gathering
about the tent set aside for the use of Noddy
and his <i>Winner</i>.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Ned, springing in that direction.
Bob and Jerry followed, and when they
got near enough they could hear shouts and calls
like the following:</p>

<p>“He must be crazy!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s the heat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did he fall from an aeroplane and land on his
head?”</p>

<p>“What’s he trying to do, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Give it up. Maybe he’s a snake charmer and
one of his reptiles got away.”</p>

<p>There were screams from several women at
this.</p>

<p>Now Jerry, Ned and Bob had pushed their way
in, and, just as they half expected when they heard
the remarks, they saw Professor Snodgrass on his
knees at the edge of the canvas shelter. He was
evidently trying to capture some bug.</p>

<p>“Might have known he’d create some excitement
before the day was over,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken than the little scientist
jumped up as if he were shot.</p>

<p>“Look out!” he cried. “There he goes!
Don’t let him get away! Oh, there he goes on
top of the tent!”</p>

<p>In an instant the professor had pushed his way
through the crowd, and seeing a rope hanging
from the top of the front pole of the hangar he
began to climb up it, the frail structure swaying
with his weight.</p>

<p>“Come back! Come back!” yelled Jerry.
“That won’t hold you!” But the scientist kept on
up the rope.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>A BREAKDOWN</small></h2>


<p>The crowd, which at first had been inclined to
be amused at the spectacle of the odd little man
shinning up a rope, was somewhat aghast at
Jerry’s cry. And indeed it was a perilous climb
that Professor Snodgrass had essayed.</p>

<p>For the hangars were rather frail, and were
only designed as shelters from the sun and rain,
being merely poles set in the earth, with a light
frame built on them, and muslin, or thin canvas,
stretched over.</p>

<p>“Come down!” pleaded Jerry. “Don’t trust
your weight to that tent, professor!”</p>

<p>“I must! I must get that insect!” he replied.
“It is a very rare kind of flying grasshopper, and
I can see it perched up on the ridge pole!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, is he crazy?” asked a man
of Ned.</p>

<p>“No, he’s only a scientific enthusiast,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>The danger of Mr. Snodgrass was now obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to all, for the frail shelter was swaying with his
weight.</p>

<p>“Here! What’s going on!” imperiously demanded
Noddy Nixon. With Bill Berry, he had
been over to the secretary’s office, and the bully
was now coming back on the run as he saw the
crowd about his tent.</p>

<p>“Get away from there!” he cried. “Ah, it’s
that Snodgrass man! He’s trying to get in our
hangar, and damage our machine. Bill, call a
policeman and have him arrested. Get down off
there, Snodgrass!” he called disrespectfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” advised Bob to the bully.
“Don’t you suppose if he wanted to get in there he
could have gone in easier than by climbing up a
rope?”</p>

<p>“Well, he has no right on our tent,” went on
Noddy.</p>

<p>“He’s after a new kind of grasshopper,” explained
Ned.</p>

<p>The professor paid no heed to the cries of
warning, nor to Jerry’s appeals. Yet he was in
grave danger. His motions, as he went up the
rope hand over hand, for he was quite an athlete,
made the main front pole of the hangar sway more
and more, and it was almost on the point of snapping
off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come back! Come back!” pleaded Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not until I get that insect!” replied the scientist.
“It is very rare. Ah, I see you, my beauty!
Keep still a moment longer and I’ll have you!”</p>

<p>He tried to reach up with a short net he took
from his pocket, meanwhile supporting himself on
the rope by one hand and by twisting his legs in
the strands. But he could not quite stretch far
enough.</p>

<p>Then he seemed to become aware of the dangerously
swaying pole, which was becoming loose in
the ground. The professor looked down at the
crowd below him.</p>

<p>“He’ll fall in another minute,” predicted a man.</p>

<p>“Get a net!” ordered some one.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“A ladder then! Get a ladder! He’ll be
killed!”</p>

<p>The professor looked longingly at the grasshopper,
then he gazed down at the crowd below
him. To his credit be it said that he was not
afraid. Yet he saw the impossibility of keeping
on. And, if he slid down, the violent motion of
the rope thus occasioned might have disastrous
results.</p>

<p>“Come on, Ned and Bob, we’ve got to save
him!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“How you going to do it?” asked the merchant’s
son.</p>

<p>“I saw a big step ladder over here!” went on
the tall lad, running toward a tent where was
housed a dirigible balloon. “It’s an immense
one. We can put it up near the rope, and he can
get down on it.”</p>

<p>They found the ladder standing outside the tent,
and it was the work of but a few seconds to rush
it back to where the scientist was still dangling.
Nor were they any too soon, for as they got it in
place the swaying pole cracked off close to the
ground, and the professor just managed to throw
himself on the ladder which was grasped and held
firm by scores of willing hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! the grasshopper got away!” exclaimed
the scientist as he reached the ground.</p>

<p>The professor thought more of the loss of the
insect than he did of his own narrow escape, but
a little later, having succeeded in capturing a
curious kind of bug in the grass near the tent of
the <i>Comet</i>, he forgot his troubles.</p>

<p>There were many interesting aerial exhibitions
that afternoon, and several small races in which
our heroes did not take part. Noddy Nixon and
Bill went in one race and won it, much to the delight
of the bully, though really he deserved small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
credit, for his machine was much more powerful
than those of his competitors.</p>

<p>Then came the turn of our friends to show what
could be done in their craft, and to the wonder of
the crowd they went up almost out of sight,
coasted down on a bank of air, propelled themselves
as a dirigible balloon, as an aeroplane, making
the change high above the earth and then did
some other intricate evolutions. They received
many vigorous rounds of applause.</p>

<p>That night our friends made a careful examination
of their craft in anticipation of the races for
high distance that were to take place on the morrow.</p>

<p>“Is Noddy going to compete against us?” asked
Bob. “I suppose he will though.”</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t!” declared Ned, who had just
come in from the secretary’s office.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh he and Bill got huffy at something, or else
they are afraid, and they have withdrawn their
entry. The secretary said Noddy was going to
take his machine and leave.”</p>

<p>“Small loss,” commented Bob.</p>

<p>There were not so many entrants in the trial
for a record elevation as there had been in the
hundred miles race, but there were enough to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
it interesting. Our heroes got a good start and
began the upward spiral climb, going higher and
higher, well in advance of all the others.</p>

<p>They were making good speed, though the
Wright biplane was creeping up on them, when
there sounded on ominous snapping sound from
the motor room.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Jerry, who was in the
pilot house.</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” offered Ned.</p>

<p>He came back with a rueful countenance.</p>

<p>“Well,” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“One of the cylinders is cracked,” reported the
merchant’s son.</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got to go down,” declared Jerry.</p>

<p>“We’re going down already,” exclaimed Bob,
looking at the barograph. It had registered a
little over two miles, but now the hand was rapidly
swinging the other way as the motor of the <i>Comet</i>
lost speed at every revolution.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>STARTLING NEWS</small></h2>


<p>There was no alarm among those aboard the
<i>Comet</i>. Our heroes had, by this time, become
used to accidents happening even higher in the air
than they now were. In fact their machine was
constructed purposely to render them safe in case
of a breakdown, for they could instantly change
from an aeroplane to a balloon, and thus float
even with the motor motionless.</p>

<p>This was what they did in the present emergency.
Jerry saw that it was useless, with one
cylinder out of commission, to try to get any speed
out of the engine.</p>

<p>“Shut down!” he ordered Bob and Ned, and the
big propellers ceased revolving.</p>

<p>“It’s tough, just when we were after a record,”
remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Can’t we go down, fix her up and try again?”
asked the stout lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“No use, Chunky,” declared the tall youth.
“It will take several days to put in a new cylinder.
No, we’ve got to give up. But we ought to be
satisfied with the prize we won.”</p>

<p>They were not, however; in fact human nature
never is, and Jerry and his chums were no different
from other lads. As they began falling downward
they could hear from below murmurs of
fear, for the great crowd thought the motorship
was wrecked.</p>

<p>“Throw in plenty of gas!” called Jerry to his
chums, and a moment later the descent of the
craft was checked as the lifting vapor rushed into
the bag. Then she floated lazily in the air, and,
in a few minutes, to reassure the watching, anxious
throng, Jerry sent her about in dips and
circles, to show that they had her under full control.</p>

<p>A cheer greeted this evidence of skill in aeronautics,
and then, there being no necessity for descending
farther the boys remained there to watch
from that vantage point the other machines climbing
upward.</p>

<p>The big Wright passed close by them, the two
occupants calling to know what the matter was.</p>

<p>“Broken cylinder,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“Too bad, old man!” came the sympathetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
hail, and then the biplane continued to poke her
nose toward the upper regions.</p>

<p>In turn a Bleriot monoplane, a Curtiss biplane,
a “Baby” Wright, a Santos Dumont, and a Farman
shot upward, while our heroes had to look
on mournfully, being out of the race.</p>

<p>A little later, when all the competing craft had
reached earth, it was announced that a biplane had
made the best record, having reached a height of
over 15,000 feet, establishing a new record.</p>

<p>“We could have beaten that if our engine hadn’t
gone back on us,” said Ned mournfully.</p>

<p>“I believe we could,” assented Jerry. “Well,
we’ll be out of it the remainder of the meet I
guess, but let’s get busy, put in a new cylinder, and
start for the West to help the professor capture
his flying frog.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, boys!” joyfully exclaimed the little
scientist. “I have had very good success here,
and only to-day I caught a little black lizard, very
rare and valuable, but I want to get after the
frog.”</p>

<p>An examination showed that they would have
to take out the cylinder and put in a new one,
and the preliminary work was started that evening.</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned were laboring in the motor
room, and Bob had been sent to tell the secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
that the <i>Comet</i> could not, as her owners had
promised, take part in a final exhibition stunt.
The stout lad came back in a hurry, exclaiming as
he entered the tent:</p>

<p>“Hey, fellows, Noddy Nixon is going!”</p>

<p>“Going where?” asked Jerry pausing, monkey
wrench in hand.</p>

<p>“Going to leave. He’s taking out his biplane,
and he and Bill are going to cut the rest of the
show just as Ned said. But they’re going off in
style. I thought he’d pack up his airship, but
he’s going off in her.”</p>

<p>Out on the grounds could be heard the rattle
and bang of a powerful motor in operation. Our
friends crowded to the tent entrance in time to see
the <i>Winner</i> shoot up into the air, with Noddy and
Bill in the seats. Then the craft, describing a
long curve, shot off toward Harmolet.</p>

<p>“I wonder where he’s going?” mused Ned.</p>

<p>“No telling,” was Jerry’s opinion. “But come
on, let’s get busy. We’ll have to go to Harmolet
to-morrow, and see if we can get another cylinder
in place of this cracked one.”</p>

<p>There was a trolley line not far from the aviation
grounds, and our three boys, catching a car
early the next morning, were soon on their way to
the city where, so some of the birdmen had assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
them, they could easily get a new cylinder, or other
parts of their machine or engine. In fact, in anticipation
of such calls being made during the meet,
one of the automobile dealers in Harmolet had
laid in a stock of airship parts.</p>

<p>Passing through a pleasant country, the boys
shortly found themselves in a good-sized city.
The car was passing through the principal street
when, as it went by a bank building, the attention
of Jerry and his chum was attracted by a large
crowd standing in front. The people overflowed
the sidewalk out on the trolley tracks.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, a run on the bank?” asked
Jerry of the conductor.</p>

<p>“Something like that,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Did the cashier skip off with the funds?” inquired
Ned.</p>

<p>“No, the safe was blown open last night, and
fifty thousand dollars in cash was taken, besides
more in securities. It was quite a sum for the
bank to lose, and I guess some of the depositors
are nervous. But most of the crowd is there out
of curiosity. The police are inside looking for
clews. I heard the news on my first trip this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Fifty thousand dollars taken!” exclaimed Bob.
“That’s a neat sum. Let’s get off here, fellows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and see if we can get a glimpse of the wrecked
vault or safe. I’ve got my camera, and maybe
they’ll let me take a snap-shot. That would be
a picture worth getting.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Jerry. “There’s no
special rush about the cylinder.”</p>

<p>They joined the throng about the bank, but
looked in vain to see some place where the side
wall had been blown out with dynamite, or some
other explosive.</p>

<p>“Guess it wasn’t much of a blow-up,” remarked
Ned in somewhat disappointed tones.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all inside,” a man in the crowd informed
them. “They nearly blew the doors off
the big safe, but nothing shows from the outside.
They got the money all right. Half the
police in town are on the job now, but last night,
when the explosion took place, not a soul heard
it.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could get inside and see it,” murmured
Bob “I’d like to take a picture.” But
there seemed no chance of this, as the police were
keeping the crowd back from the front of the
building.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>SEEKING CLEWS</small></h2>


<p>“Come on, let’s go around this way,” proposed
Ned in a low voice to his chums, as a little later,
he pointed to a side alley that apparently led to
the rear of the bank.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” urged Bob, who had his small
pocket camera ready. There were but few persons
near the alley, and our chums were just entering
it quietly, when a voice called out:</p>

<p>“Hey! Where you fellers goin’?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just up here,” replied Jerry, in non-committal
tones.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have to keep out. I got orders
not to allow any strangers in there, and—why
hello! If it isn’t the motor boys from Cresville!
Why, how are you?” and the man, evidently
a watchman, or a policeman in plain clothes,
extended his hand toward Jerry, a smile illuminating
his face. “How’d you come here?” went on
the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, if it isn’t Mr. Thompson!” exclaimed
Jerry in amazement. “How in the world did you
get here?”</p>

<p>“Sort of a mutual surprise party,” murmured
Ned. “Hello, Mr. Thompson.”</p>

<p>“All three of you, eh?” went on the guard.
“Jerry, Ned and Bob. Well, I’m glad to see
you,” and he shook hands with each of them in
turn. Mr. Thompson had lived in Cresville for
many years and had done some work for Mrs.
Hopkins at odd times. The boys knew him very
well, but of late years had not seen him, for he
had moved away from their town.</p>

<p>“How comes it that you are here?” asked
Jerry. “Do you work in the bank?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m one of the Harmolet police force.
I’ve been on about two years now. I knocked
about the country after leaving Cresville, and
finally settled down here. I’m a regular officer
now, and if I catch you boys cutting up I’ll run
you in!” and the man laughed at his joke.</p>

<p>“Where’s your uniform?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Didn’t have time to put it on. Soon as this
robbery was discovered the chief sent for all the
reserve men. I was home sleeping, after my
night on duty, but I had to get up. We’ve got
all the men we can spare on this job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“What for?” asked Jerry. “Especially after
the money is gone—fifty thousand dollars of it?”</p>

<p>“Sixty thousand would be nearer the figure,”
declared Mr. Thompson. “It does seem sort of
like locking the stable door after the horse is
stolen, but orders from the chief are orders. Besides,
it takes quite a few of us to keep the crowd
back, and the rest are looking for clews.”</p>

<p>“Inside the bank?” Ned wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Inside and outside. The robbers made a neat
job of it, and the funny part of it is that we can’t
seem to find out how they got in and got out
again. However they got the money all right—a
clean sixty thousand. But what are you boys
doing here?”</p>

<p>“We took part in the airship meet at Colton,”
said Jerry; and they told Officer Thompson about
it, of how they had seen the crowd, and stopped
off the car to learn the cause of the excitement.</p>

<p>“I wanted to get a picture of the wrecked safe,”
put in Bob, “but I——”</p>

<p>“Say now, I’m glad I met you,” interrupted
Mr. Thompson. “It’s a little against orders,
but I guess I can let you in, especially as no one
is looking. Slip around in back of me, and go to
the rear door. Wait there for me, and as soon
as I can get some one to take my place I’ll bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
you in, and show you the way they did it. It’s
worth seeing.”</p>

<p>They had not been waiting at the rear door of
the bank more than a few minutes, and had seen,
through the windows, a number of men hurrying
here and there, when their friend came up.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said Mr. Thompson. “Come
on, I’ll take you in.”</p>

<p>Piloted by the former Cresville resident, our
friends entered the bank. A scene of confusion
greeted them. The officers and clerks of the institution
were hurrying to and fro with books and
papers, and from the president’s room came the
murmur of voices.</p>

<p>“The directors are having a meeting to decide
what to do,” explained Mr. Thompson. “Likely
they’ll offer a big reward. I’d like to pull it down
myself, but the detectives will probably get this
job. They ought to offer at least five thousand
for the recovery of the sixty thousand.”</p>

<p>“Sixty thousand? They got more than that!”
exclaimed a policeman in uniform who nodded
to Mr. Thompson and the boys in a friendly
fashion.</p>

<p>“More than that?” repeated our heroes’ friend
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Sure. The sixty was mostly in paper money—bills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of big denomination, and a lot of double
eagles—they left the silver scattered around.
Probably it was too heavy to carry, though there
was plenty of it. But they took a hundred and
fifty thousand dollars more in negotiable securities—stocks,
bonds and so on.”</p>

<p>“A hundred and fifty thousand!” gasped Bob.</p>

<p>“Two hundred and ten thousand dollars in
all!” half-whispered Ned. “That <em>was</em> a haul!”</p>

<p>“Come on over this way, and I’ll show you
where they took it from,” proceeded Mr. Thompson,
and the boys followed. They halted in front
of a massive safe, built into the wall in the form
of a vault, and a scene of ruin met their eyes.</p>

<p>The big doors were shattered and twisted, and
one had been completely torn from the hinges and
lay on the floor. The inner doors, of less weight,
had also been blown open. Even yet books and
papers, and many silver coins, lay scattered about,
the clerks not yet having had time to pick them
up.</p>

<p>“It was a good job all right,” explained the
former Cresville man;—“that is, good from a
burglar’s standpoint, though they used more juice
than they needed to.”</p>

<p>“Juice?” queried Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, nitro-glycerine you know. They carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
it in a bottle, drill a hole in the door, pour it in,
tamp it with soap, and set it off with a fuse.
They must have blown the doors when a train
was going past so as to deaden the noise, for no
one heard it.”</p>

<p>“Where was the watchman?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“The bank didn’t keep one, but I guess they
will after this,” replied Mr. Thompson grimly.
“They’d have saved money if they had had a man
on guard. Here you can see where they started
to drill a hole in the door, and changed their
minds. Probably it wasn’t in the right place.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a small hole, neatly made in the
hard steel.</p>

<p>“Took a pretty good drill for that,” was Jerry’s
opinion.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was a power-drill,” said the policeman.
“Oh, these were up-to-date crooks all right, and
they made a good get-away.”</p>

<p>“How’d they get in?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they’ve found out yet. You
see this is the first time we’ve had a big robbery
like this, and it’s sort of upset the force. It’s
a mystery how they got in.”</p>

<p>“The detectives have about solved it though,”
put in an officer in uniform.</p>

<p>“How?” inquired Mr. Thompson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Through the roof scuttle. One of ’em—Blake
I think it was—just discovered some finger
marks in the dust around the scuttle, and it was
found unhooked, so he’s pretty sure they came in
from the roof.”</p>

<p>“How’d they get on the roof?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s what they’ve got to find out,” went on
the policeman.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I could take these friends of mine
up and have a look?” ventured Mr. Thompson.</p>

<p>“Sure,” assented the other. “There’s not
much to see though. I guess the best clews will
be found down here.”</p>

<p>Bob wanted to take several snap shots of the
wrecked safe, and Ned and Jerry waited for him.
Meanwhile two or three detectives were observed
poking about in the ruins, and the litter of paper
for possible clews.</p>

<p>“Come on, Chunky, you’ve got pictures
enough,” called Ned finally. “Let’s take a look
at the roof, and you can make a snap shot there,
and then we’ll get over to the store, buy the cylinder,
and fix up our motorship.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented the stout lad, closing his
camera; and then Mr. Thompson led the boys up
to the roof of the bank.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>A NEW THEORY</small></h2>


<p>“Those robbers probably came in a light, rubber-tired
rig, left it somewhere around the corner,
got into the bank, did the job and drove away
again,” was the opinion of Mr. Thompson, as he
crawled out of the roof scuttle, followed by the
boys.</p>

<p>“But how did they get to the roof?” asked Ned.
“You’ve got to explain that.”</p>

<p>“Easy enough,” spoke the policeman. “You
see this bank is in a row, with several other buildings,
all about the same height. They could have
climbed up the fire escapes, or they could have
used a ladder. I’m inclined to the latter theory
myself, for the fire escapes are on the front of
the buildings, and if they went up them they’d be
seen, whereas they could put a ladder up in back.”</p>

<p>The boys looked about them, and Bob took a
couple of snap shots, including one of his two
chums and the officer as they stood near the opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
scuttle. As Mr. Thompson had said there was
not much to see. The roof was a long one, extending
over several buildings, and being flat, and
covered with a composition of tar and gravel, alternating
with tin on some of the structures, made
quite a place to stroll about.</p>

<p>Jerry walked a little away from Ned and Bob,
who were listening to Mr. Thompson’s explanation
of how Detective Blake had discovered the
finger marks in the dust around the scuttle rim,
and had thus made his discovery.</p>

<p>“Blake thinks the scuttle was left unhooked, or
else that the thieves reached in with a bent wire,
and lifted the hook from the catch,” said the
policeman.</p>

<p>The tall lad was walking over a stretch of tin
roof, on a building two or three doors from the
looted bank. There had been rain two days previous,
followed by a brisk wind, which dried out
the dust, and there was now quite a coating of
the latter on the tin. There was also something
else, and as Jerry caught sight of several marks
in the dirt-coating he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Somebody with rubber-soled tennis shoes has
been walking up here,” he said.</p>

<p>He bent closer over the footprints, and then
he saw another mark that caused him to spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
up quickly, and call to his companions and the
policeman.</p>

<p>“Look here!” he cried, beckoning to them.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded Ned, coming
up on the run.</p>

<p>“Easy! Easy!” cautioned Jerry. “Don’t
trample on these marks. Look! If some one
hasn’t been up here on a bicycle I miss my guess!”</p>

<p>“A bicycle!” exclaimed Bob. “Do you mean
to say that the robbers rode a bicycle up here?”</p>

<p>“There are the marks of the rubber tires plain
enough,” replied Jerry, pointing to them.</p>

<p>“That’s no bicycle track!” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“Why not?” the tall lad wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Or, if it is, the fellow rode on one wheel, or
else is more expert than anyone I ever saw. See,
there’s only one straight mark, and the best rider
in the world turns his front wheel every now and
then, making a separate track from the rear one.
That’s no bicycle mark.”</p>

<p>“What is it then?” demanded Jerry. “Did
some one roll a single bicycle wheel about on the
roof for fun?”</p>

<p>Before Ned could reply, Bob, who had gone off
several paces to the left, uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“Here’s another!” he shouted, pointing to the
dusty tin roof. His companions hastened over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
taking care to keep off the tracks, and there saw
another mark, exactly like the first.</p>

<p>For a moment Jerry Hopkins stared at the second
impression. Then he went back to look at
the first one. Next he hurried forward and began
looking at a space about midway between the
two tire tracks. His companions and the policeman
watched him curiously. Suddenly Jerry
threw up his hand as a signal.</p>

<p>“I’ve found it!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“The third track!” was the response. “Fellows
it was no bicycle up here. It was——”</p>

<p>“An aeroplane!” fairly burst out Ned and Bob
together, for now, with the discovery of the third
impression, midway between and ahead of the
first two, it was very plain to anyone who had had
to do with aeroplanes that they were the marks
of the three landing, or starting wheels, of such
a craft, that had left the marks in the dust of the
roof.</p>

<p>“An airship!” exclaimed the policeman. “Do
you boys mean to say that an airship has been up
here?”</p>

<p>“It certainly has,” declared Jerry firmly.
“Look here! There are more marks farther
on.” He pointed just beyond a blank space,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
where the tin roof was clean of dust, and the
marks were again visible in the soft tar of another
roof. “They landed here and made a start from
here. They could easily do it. In fact this long,
flat roof with the tar and gravel to give good
traction, is an ideal starting place for an aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“An aeroplane on the roof!” murmured the
officer, as if unable to believe it. “Do you think,
Jerry——”</p>

<p>“I think,” interrupted the tall lad, “that the
bank burglars came through the air, made a landing
here unseen by anyone in the street, went down
the scuttle, looted the safe, and made a flying
start from this roof.”</p>

<p>“Wait! Wait!” begged Mr. Thompson.
“This is a new theory—I never heard the like before.
It needs a regular detective to consider
this. Wait until I get Blake up here. I’ll wager
it’ll be news to him. Wait here for me.”</p>

<p>He hurried down the scuttle, and the boys
eagerly looked for more impressions and talked
about Jerry’s discovery. They went to the end
of the row of buildings, and there, where the roof
was of tar and gravel, they found in the soft
black material the plain impression of the three
wheels. They came to a sudden stop before “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
jumping-off place,” as Jerry called it, was reached.</p>

<p>“Here’s where they sailed into the air,” he declared
confidently.</p>

<p>“Let’s see if we can find where they landed,”
suggested Ned.</p>

<p>They did, at the opposite end of the row of
roofs, just where a tall building reared itself
several stories higher than the row of low structures.</p>

<p>“They came down here all right,” declared
Jerry excitedly pointing to the deep impression
made by the wheels. The boys even found the
place where the drag-brake had scraped a long
line in the gravel, and that, to them, made their
“case complete.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the merchant’s son uttered a cry, and
straightened up.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry in surprise.</p>

<p>“Those wheel marks!” gasped Ned. “Look!
Those are new tires, Jerry. Not worn a bit, and
they’re the anti-skid style—see the corrugations
and the rubber-protruding cleats.”</p>

<p>“I see ’em—what of it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember—Noddy Nixon’s aeroplane—after
he put on the new wheels, following
his smash-up? Don’t you remember? He had
wheels just like these—exactly like them. Look!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry glanced at his chum with wide-opened
eyes. Then he looked down at the marks. The
light of remembrance came into his eyes.</p>

<p>“By Jove, Ned, you’re right!” he exclaimed.
“Noddy Nixon and Bill Berry—and that talk I
overheard between them—Noddy Nixon—his
aeroplane—I——”</p>

<p>At that moment Detective Blake, followed by
President Carter of the looted bank, and several
of the directors, came out on the roof.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>SUSPICIONS</small></h2>


<p>“How about it, Jerry?” asked Ned in a low
voice, as the bank officials and the police approached.
“Shall we tell ’em what we think?”</p>

<p>“And put ’em on Noddy’s track?” went on Bob.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so. Keep quiet. Leave it to
me a while. I want to consider it. No, I guess
we won’t say anything except that we believe an
aeroplane was used. We needn’t say we have
a suspicion as to whose it was.”</p>

<p>Thus Jerry answered his chums, and when the
bank president, and the others, reached the side
of the boys the tall lad was ready for them.</p>

<p>“What’s this the detective tells me you’ve discovered
about an aeroplane being used?” asked
Mr. Carter, incredulously.</p>

<p>“I think—in fact I’m sure one was,” declared
Jerry. “It seems a strange thing to say, and a
few years ago of course would have been out of
the question, but it is not now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, with Ned and Bob putting in an occasional
remark Jerry carefully explained his theory,
pointed out the impressions of the anti-skid tires,
and showed where the airship had landed, and
where the robbers had gotten their start for a
flight into the air.</p>

<p>“Hum!” mused President Carter, “I am almost
convinced in spite of myself, young man. It certainly
is an ingenuous explanation. What do you
think of it, gentlemen?” and he turned to the
directors. Some of them were plainly skeptical,
some were half convinced, and one or two, who
had seen some recent airship flights, expressed
their belief in Jerry’s theory.</p>

<p>“What have you to say, Mr. Blake?” asked the
president, of the detective.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I hardly know. I never had any
experience with a safe robber who used an airship,
and yet, as this young man says, it might
be possible. If it is we’re going to have a hard
time to trace the thieves. It isn’t as if they had
used an auto or a carriage. The air doesn’t leave
any marks or traces.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all nonsense! Utter nonsense!” interrupted
a tall, thin director. “Preposterous!
Why it’s out of the question. An airship indeed!
You might as well tell me it was spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
that robbed the bank. I don’t believe a word of
it! Besides, who are these boys who originate
such a foolish theory. Do they know anything
about airships?”</p>

<p>“They certainly do!” broke in Mr. Thompson
with great earnestness. “They have been running
one of the best airships ever made, and they
just won the hundred mile race at Colton in their
motorship <i>Comet</i>.”</p>

<p>For a moment the director who had ridiculed
the theory of our friends looked first at them,
and then at the officer. A change came over his
face.</p>

<p>“Oh, these are those boys; eh?” he asked. “I—er—I
read about that race—and they own the
<i>Comet</i>? The craft that made that marvelous
rescue in midair of Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson is
a friend of mine. He told me about that. It
was very wonderful. Well, of course that puts
a different face on it. If these are the motor
boys, and they say an airship was used to rob
our bank, why, I don’t know—of course I don’t
understand much about such things, Mr. Carter—but
I should say—not to be too positive of course—but
I should say these boys know what they are
talking about. Oh, yes, I believe I agree with
them, and the best thing we can do it to get some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
circulars printed, offering a reward for the capture
of the airship bank robbers.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, and I think these lads are
right,” spoke the president. “The next thing to
do is to consider ways and means for capturing the
robbers, and also how we can best protect our
credit. For there will, no doubt, be a run on the
bank as soon as the full news leaks out, as it will.
I think we had better resume our deliberations,
gentlemen. And I suggest that we have these
boys before us, and question them. They may
be able to give us some valuable clews.”</p>

<p>Once more the directors were in session, and
Jerry and his chums told over again, and with
more detail, how they had come to form their
theory as to the airship.</p>

<p>“Now that is settled,” began the president,
“the question arises, what sort of an airship was
used, whose it might be, and where we can look
for it? Can you boys enlighten us on those
items?”</p>

<p>These were the questions Jerry had been fearing
would be asked. He was in a peculiar position.
He and his chums had well-grounded suspicions
against Noddy and Bill, and yet Jerry
thought it would hardly be fair to disclose them.</p>

<p>“It would be very hard, Mr. Carter,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Jerry, “to say what kind of an aeroplane was
used. In general they are all alike as regards the
use of bicycle wheels. I should say that this was
a large biplane, and that at least two men were
in her.”</p>

<p>“Easily two men,” confirmed Detective Blake.
“No one man alone could have blown the vault
open.”</p>

<p>“As to finding out who they were,” went on
Jerry, “I think the best plan would be to make inquiries
among the makers of aeroplanes in this
vicinity regarding the persons who have purchased
machines lately, and also what machine
was fitted with those peculiarly marked tires. Do
that, at the same time send out a description of
the missing securities, and have detectives in different
parts of the country on the lookout for
birdmen who have plenty of money to spend, and
I believe you’ve done all that is possible—at least
for the present.”</p>

<p>“Why, have you any hope for the future?”
asked the president, struck by some peculiar meaning
in Jerry’s tone.</p>

<p>“No—that is I—well, my chums and myself
intend going off on a trip soon, and I was going
to say that we would be on the lookout also, and,
if we heard anything, we’d let you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mr. Carter genially. “I
believe your advice is good, and we’ll follow it.
Did you make a note of it, Mr. Blake?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, part of it has already been done.
We have wired to all big cities for the police to be
on the lookout for the thieves, and brief descriptions
of the stolen securities have been wired
broadcast. A printer is now setting up a circular
to be posted in all railroad stations and other
public places, so you see we have covered that end.
I’ll at once get busy among the aeroplane makers
and tire people, and as soon as I have anything
worth while I’ll let you and the other gentlemen
know.”</p>

<p>“Very good, and if these young men can get
any trace of the robbers we’d be glad to hear
from them. We are about to consider the matter
of offering a reward, and that will soon be
made public.”</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums, as well as several detectives
who were in the room took this as a hint
that they might now withdraw, and they did so.
The motor boys, after a little further talk with
their friend Mr. Thompson, and lingering a while
to look at the large and increasing crowd about
the bank, proceeded to the supply house to get
a new cylinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we certainly ran into a bunch of news
that time,” remarked Jerry, when, having purchased
what they needed, they were on the trolley,
going back to Colton.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we haven’t heard the last of it,”
commented Ned. “What are we going to do
about Noddy being mixed up in it?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know,” replied the tall lad. “It certainly
looks as if he and Bill were in it. Yet I
hate to inform on them.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t right to let them get away with
all that money—especially when some of it belongs
to poor depositors,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“You’re right, Chunky. I guess we’ll have to
tell all we know,” and Jerry looked solemn. It
was a duty to be performed, and Jerry was not one
to shrink from it, no matter how unpleasant it
might be.</p>

<p>“When you think of the talk he and Bill had
that night you overheard them,” went on Ned,
“there isn’t much doubt of Noddy’s guilt.
Weren’t they saying something about doing a job,
and getting away from the police?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the tall lad.</p>

<p>“Then you can depend upon it they’re the guilty
ones. I say let’s go back and tell the bank people
about Noddy’s tires.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“No—not yet—wait a day,” advised Jerry.
“If it was Noddy and Bill they can’t get far away,
and we seem to have the faculty of butting into
them often.”</p>

<p>“But they may spend all that money,” objected
Bob.</p>

<p>“Hardly two hundred and ten thousand dollars
in a few days,” replied Jerry. “We’ll take a little
longer to think of it, and then we’ll decide what
to do. If we make up our minds to take a flight
after the robbers—whether they are Noddy and
Bill, or some one else—we’ll have to get the
<i>Comet</i> in shape. Come on now, we’ll get busy
and we won’t think anything more about the
robbery until we have to.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>A BIG REWARD</small></h2>


<p>There were several more events to come off
in the aviation meet, but our friends were unable
to take part in them because they found it a harder
and longer task to put in the new cylinder than
they had anticipated. But they had time to stop
occasionally, and watch the birdmen in their dizzy
flights high in the air or about the big valley
where the contests were held.</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums finished work on the engine
one afternoon, the day before the close of the
meet, and yielding to the entreaties of the secretary
and the other officials they gave an exhibition
flight that was greeted with cheers.</p>

<p>“And this is the end of the meet,” remarked
Jerry as they sat in their tent that night, for the
next day would come the awarding of such prizes
as had not previously been given out, and then
the affair would be over.</p>

<p>“Well, what are we going to do?” asked Bob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
“Have you made up your mind any further regarding
Noddy and the robbery, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“No, and I can hardly say what we ought to
do. Sometimes I feel like telling President Carter
and the detectives everything, and again, suppose
I should be wrong? It wouldn’t be very
nice falsely to accuse even a fellow like Noddy
Nixon.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell the facts in the case,
and let people draw their own conclusions,” suggested
Ned. “You can tell of the conversation
you heard between Bill and Noddy, and about the
tires on Noddy’s machine. Then drop out of it,
and tell them to work the clews as they see fit.”</p>

<p>“I believe that would be a good way out of it,”
assented the tall lad. “I’ll do it. We’ll go to
the bank to-morrow, and then we’ll start on a
trip out west and see if we can’t get that flying
frog for the professor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t know how anxious I am to start
on that quest!” cried the scientist. “I can hardly
wait! And so we will go to-morrow. Still, I
can’t complain. I caught a pink striped June
bug to-day, a very rare and valuable specimen,”
and then the little man began poring over his
note books.</p>

<p>There was little of interest to our heroes at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the aviation grounds the next day, and Jerry and
his chums made a trip in to Harmolet with the
intention of having an interview with the bank
president and the chief detective.</p>

<p>As they neared the bank building they saw in
front of it almost as large a crowd as had been
there the morning after the robbery.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Ned. “I guess the run
is still keeping up. Let’s get off the car and see
what’s doing.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the robbers came back for the silver
they didn’t take,” suggested Bob with a laugh.</p>

<p>By dint of pushing this way and that, the lads
managed to get to a place where they could read
a notice, which, printed in large type, posted on
the side of the bank building. It caught Jerry’s
eyes at once. The notice read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noic">$10,000 REWARD!</p>

<p>The above reward will be paid to any person
or persons who shall cause the arrest and conviction
of the robber or robbers who, on the night
of July 15, broke into this bank, and stole bank
notes to the amount of sixty thousand dollars,
and negotiable securities to the amount of one
hundred and fifty thousand. About four thousand
dollars in gold was also taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>It is believed that the robbers used an aeroplane
to land on the roof and in which to make
their escape. The above reward will be paid immediately
on the conviction of the robbers.</p>

<p>“Well, they’ve officially adopted our airship
theory,” remarked Ned, with a smile at his chums.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I guess now will be as good a time
as any to tell what more we know,” suggested
Jerry. “Come on, we’ll ask to see Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>They were making their way through the press
of people and finding it no easy matter, when Ned
almost knocked down a boy who, with three small
bicycle tires hanging over his shoulder was standing
on his tiptoes, trying to look over the heads
of the crowd to read the reward notice.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon!” exclaimed Ned. “Did
I hurt you?”</p>

<p>“Naw, not a bit!” exclaimed the lad good naturedly.
He was a typical errand boy, always
glad of an excuse to stop and “kill” time. “Dat’s
a swell reward de bank is offerin’,” he volunteered.
“I wish I could cop it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it wouldn’t be bad,” said Bob. As for
Ned, after the first shock of the collision, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
his apology, he was looking at the lad in a curious
fashion—yet not so much at the boy as at
the bicycle tires he carried.</p>

<p>“Look!” whispered Ned to Jerry, pointing to
the rubber circlets. “Those are tires for aeroplane
wheels,” went on the merchant’s son, “and
they’re marked just like those Noddy had on his
machine. Jerry, here’s a clew right under our
noses!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>THE RAG ON THE STATUE</small></h2>


<p>The attention of the boy with the tires was so
much taken up with trying to look over the heads
of the people about him, that, for a time, he did
not notice the excitement of Jerry and his two
chums caused by the unexpected discovery.</p>

<p>“They are the same tires,” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” agreed Jerry. “What shall we
do?”</p>

<p>“Let’s get this lad off in some quiet place, and
talk to him,” proposed Ned. “We’ll ask him
where he works, and whether his firm sold any
tires to an aeroplane owner lately.”</p>

<p>“He’d hardly know about that,” objected the
tall lad, “but we’ll question him, anyhow. I’ll
talk to him.”</p>

<p>After considering the matter for a few seconds,
and turning over in his mind the best way to get
at what he wanted to know, Jerry touched the lad
on the shoulder, and asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you got a few minutes to spare?”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked the boy suspiciously, taking
a firmer hold of the rubber tires.</p>

<p>“We want to ask you a few questions.”</p>

<p>“What about?” and the lad backed away.</p>

<p>“About those tires,” and Jerry indicated them.</p>

<p>“Where can we get some like them?”</p>

<p>“At the store where I work, Johnson and Carroll,
236 Main street. It’s just down about two
blocks.”</p>

<p>“Are you delivering these tires to some aeroplane
owner?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, I’m taking these back to the store. They
were out at the meet in Colton.”</p>

<p>“Colton!” gasped Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, some fellows that had an aeroplane out
there sent for some extra ones just before the
exhibition opened. They wanted a heavy anti-skid
kind—wanted several sets of ’em, in case
they punctured some. So I took out three sets—nine
in all. But those fellows left before the
meet opened, and I was sent to-day, when it closed,
to get the tires they hadn’t used. They left word
at the store that the unused tires would be found
in their tent, but the boss didn’t think to send
me for ’em before. Those fellows used only one
set, and left two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“What were the names of those men?” asked
Jerry with growing excitement.</p>

<p>“Brown and Black!” answered the lad, and he
was little prepared for the flurry caused among
his questioners by his unexpected answer.</p>

<p>“Brown and Black!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yep. Was they friends of yours?” asked the
boy.</p>

<p>“No, not exactly, but we had met them. So
they used this style of tires on their wheels?”
Jerry’s brain was in a whirl. His suspicions
against Noddy were disappearing.</p>

<p>“But how is it, if they left two sets, or six tires,
that you only have one set of three here?” asked
Ned. “Couldn’t you carry them?”</p>

<p>“Sure, but they weren’t in the tent that Brown
and Black had used before they left. There was
only these three tires there. At first I thought
some one had swiped the extra set, but the secretary
of the exhibition paid me for ’em.”</p>

<p>“Had he used them?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“No, but some fellow who had an accident and
needed new wheels and tires on his airship heard
about these tires in the vacant tent, and he took
three, giving the money for ’em to the secretary.
The secretary knew they were our tires, and kept
the money for us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Were the tires exactly like these?” asked
Jerry, as he noted that the ridges and corrugations
corresponded to the marks on the roof of the
bank.</p>

<p>“Just like ’em,” replied the lad. “The fellow
whose airship had a smash, and Brown and
Black, each have a set like ’em. They’re great
for airships. Maybe you’d like a set.”</p>

<p>“Later, perhaps,” assented Jerry who could not
but admire the lad’s business instinct. But Jerry
had something else to think about just then.
“Who was the man who bought the extra set of
tires, and left the money for them with the secretary?”
asked the tall lad.</p>

<p>“A young feller named Noddy Nixon,” replied
the messenger promptly.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon!” exclaimed Ned and Bob in a
breath. It was the answer they had expected,
but, nevertheless, it startled them.</p>

<p>“Huh! Do you know him too?” asked the
boy.</p>

<p>“Slightly,” admitted Jerry. “We’re much
obliged to you. Here’s a dime for some ice
cream soda,” and then, fearing the lad would ask
questions that might be embarrassing to answer,
Jerry pulled his two chums to one side, and they
soon lost sight of the messenger and his tires in
the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, wouldn’t that make you want to go in
swimming?” demanded Ned, when they could
talk freely.</p>

<p>“It’s certainly got me going,” admitted Bob,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>“And it knocks most of our theory squeegee!”
said Jerry, shaking his head. “There are two
aeroplanes fitted with those peculiar tires—Noddy’s
and Brown and Black’s. Now which
one landed on the roof of the bank?”</p>

<p>“Give it up,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>“Same here,” replied Ned. “It’s too deep for
me.”</p>

<p>“Who’d ever think of such a thing?” went on
Jerry. “When Noddy smashed his wheels that
time he must have heard about those extra tires
that Brown and Black didn’t use, and he put them
on his machine. Then those two men already
had a similar set on, and—there you are.”</p>

<p>“Or rather, there you—aren’t,” suggested Ned.
“Now who committed the robbery—Noddy or
the other fellows? You ‘pays your money and
you takes your choice,’ as the fellow said in the
circus.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to tell President Carter now?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do,” replied Jerry, with
a puzzled shake of his head. “This puts an entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
new turn on it. Let’s go off and talk it
over.”</p>

<p>“There’s a little park somewhere up this way,
not far from the bank,” suggested Bob. “It’s
got a statue and a fountain in it, and right across
the street is a nice restaurant. I noticed it the
other day. We could go to the park, sit down,
and——”</p>

<p>“Then go to the restaurant and have something
to eat; eh Chunky?” asked Jerry with a smile.</p>

<p>They walked on in silence and soon came to the
little park of which Bob had spoken. It was
prettily laid out, and in the centre was a large
fountain, surmounted by a large statue on a
pedestal, the statue being that of a man on a
horse, holding aloft a bronze object that represented
an ancient torch.</p>

<p>As the boys came in sight of this art work
they saw several men gathered about it, and one
was raising a long ladder to the shoulder of the
figure.</p>

<p>“What’s going on, I wonder?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re going to wash the man’s face,
or feed the horse,” observed Ned. “How about
it, Chunky?”</p>

<p>A man was now mounting the long ladder, and
looking up our friends saw, fluttering from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
torch which the bronze figure held aloft, a long
rag.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Jerry of one of the workmen
who was holding the ladder steady.</p>

<p>“Oh the sparrows have carried a rag up on the
statue to build a nest in the torch I guess,” replied
the man. “The birds like to get in there,
but they make such a litter of straw, grass and
rags, that we have to clean it out every once in a
while. The top of the torch is hollow, you see,
and it makes a good place for ’em. But I never
knew ’em to take up such a big rag before. It’s
been there several days, but we’ve been so busy
cutting the grass that we haven’t had time to take
it down. To-day there was a letter in the paper
from some old lady, who said the rag looked bad,
so the superintendent of the park told us to get
it down.”</p>

<p>The explanation was satisfactory, and the boys
watched the man climb up, and pull down the
offending rag.</p>

<p>“Pretty good size for sparrows to take up,”
he remarked to his fellow workmen, as he descended.
“There was this package in the hollow
torch, too. I wonder how it got there?”</p>

<p>He tossed the rag on a barrel full of leaves and
paper refuse that had been swept up on the park<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
paths. Something about the cloth attracted the
attention of Jerry, who picked it up. No sooner
had he felt of it than he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Fellows!” he cried, “this isn’t an ordinary rag.
It’s a piece of canvas such as airship planes are
made of!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Jerry. “See, it’s just the
kind we use—in fact nearly all planes are made
from this kind, which is woven especially for the
purpose.”</p>

<p>“An airship; eh?” mused the foreman of the
park laborers. “Maybe it dropped from some of
the machines that were flying out at Colton.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t drop, it was torn off,” declared
Jerry, looking at the ragged edges. “Some airship
went too close to the statue, and a wing
tip, or a rudder hit the torch. It was risky flying
all right.”</p>

<p>“Then it must have been done at night,” declared
the foreman, “for some of the men are on
duty in this park all day, and they’d have seen
it if anything like that happened.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was a night flight,” assented Jerry,
as he looked at Bob and Ned. The same thought
was in the minds of all of them—the aeroplane of
the bank robbers!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that other thing you found in the
torch?” asked Ned of the man who had climbed
the ladder.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It’s pretty heavy. Likely it
was dropped by the fellows in the airship. I’ll
undo it.”</p>

<p>He took off the wrapping paper, disclosing a
small flat stone. As he did so two pieces of white
paper fluttered to the ground. Jerry picked them
up, and, as he read what was written on them he
could not repress a cry of surprise.</p>

<p>For the names that confronted him were those
of Noddy Nixon and Bill Berry!</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>OFF ON THE HUNT</small></h2>


<p>“Don’t talk any more—come away,” advised
Jerry in a low voice to his chums, as he handed
back the slips of paper. “We want to talk this
over among ourselves.”</p>

<p>“The restaurant’s the place,” decided Bob, and
neither Jerry nor Ned laughed at him this time.</p>

<p>The three lads talked in guarded tones as they
sat at a table in the eating place, waiting to be
served. The new turn to the mystery had come
with startling suddenness.</p>

<p>“Now whom do you think committed the robbery?”
asked Ned. “It begins to look as though
Brown and Black were out of it; eh?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” was the answer of the tall lad.
“It was more likely them than Noddy and Bill.
Not that the latter wouldn’t do it if they had the
chance, but I don’t believe they know enough to
drill a safe. Then there are those queer tools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
we saw in the <i>Silver Star</i>. One of them was a
safe drill, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“But do you think there were two airships
circling around Harmolet the night of the robbery?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s possible. We saw Noddy head in that
direction, and though Brown and Black left the
aviation grounds before we reached them, they
might have returned to rob the bank. I’m sure
they did it.”</p>

<p>“And I’m sure Noddy did,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“But why was he so close to the statue?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“There’s no telling,” answered Jerry. “Maybe
he did it just for a daring stunt. Leaving his
name there makes it look that way.”</p>

<p>But Ned was sure Noddy and Bill had robbed
the bank, and nothing his chums could say would
make him change his opinion.</p>

<p>“Then the only thing to do is to go to President
Carter, tell him what we have found out,
and what we know, and let him do as he likes,”
suggested Jerry. “We’ll mention about the queer
tools we saw in the airship of Brown and Black,
and how angry they were because we looked at
their machine. Then the police can get busy, but
I don’t envy them their job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you’ll tell about the conversation you
overheard between Bill and Noddy; won’t you?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Then that’ll clinch the guilt on them all right,
and we can divide the reward between us.”</p>

<p>“Wait until we get it first,” advised Jerry
drily.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter was much startled when told of
the new developments in the case, and when informed
of the suspicions of Jerry and his chums.</p>

<p>“You did right not to speak of them before,”
he said, “as the discovery of the tires puts a different
face on it. I, myself, believe those two men
Brown and Black, if those are their real names,
are the guilty persons.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find it was Noddy,” declared Ned
firmly.</p>

<p>“Everyone is entitled to his own theory,” said
the president with a smile. “Now I am going
to summon here as many of the directors as I
can get in touch with. I’d like them to hear the
stories of you young men. Would it be asking
too much to request you to wait here?”</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums were willing, and the president
sent out and got the latest magazines for
them to read while they were waiting.</p>

<p>“I may have an offer to make to you after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
meeting,” he said with a smile, when a messenger
had informed him that several of the directors
were on their way to the bank.</p>

<p>The boys indulged in several speculations as to
what Mr. Carter might want with them after the
meeting, which was soon being held in the directors’
room. It was not a lengthy session, and in
a little while a messenger came to summon the
boys.</p>

<p>“You are to appear before the president and
directors,” he said in awed tones.</p>

<p>“My! We’re getting to be quite important!”
remarked Bob.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter came to the point at once.</p>

<p>“Young men,” he said, “I have told the directors
what you have related to me. They wish to
thank you for the pains you have taken, and they
highly commend your course. Now they have a
request to make of you.</p>

<p>“As you are doubtless aware, a reward of ten
thousand dollars has been offered for the arrest
and conviction of the thieves. We thought we
would make it big, as the sum taken was large,
and unless some of it at least, is recovered, our
bank may be seriously embarrassed. As it is we
have been able temporarily to tide over our
affairs.</p>

<p>“Now, what I wish to know, and what these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
gentlemen have commissioned me to ask you motor
boys, is whether you will not undertake to find
the thieves for us?</p>

<p>“We’d like to have you undertake the search,
not only because you have discovered the first
clews,” proceeded the president, “but because you
have an airship, and can thus go where no other
persons could. The police have no such advantage.
Will you undertake this quest for us?”</p>

<p>Jerry looked at his chums, and they looked at
him. Evidently they were waiting for him to
speak.</p>

<p>“May we—that is, I’d like to talk with my
friends before answering,” said Jerry, after a
pause.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Take all the time you need.”</p>

<p>The tall lad drew his companions into a corner
of the big room.</p>

<p>“Shall we do it, boys?” he asked.</p>

<p>“But we don’t know where to look for ’em,
whether it’s Noddy, or those other two fellows?”
objected Ned.</p>

<p>“No, not yet, but we may be able to pick up
some clews by circling around Harmolet. Shall
we have a try for the ten thousand?”</p>

<p>“I’m game,” declared Bob. “We were going
off on a trip anyhow, to help the professor get his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
flying frog, and we might as well combine business
with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m willing,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” answered Jerry. “We’ll
go!”</p>

<p>He turned to the president and announced the
decision of himself and his chums.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the bank official. “I was
pretty sure you’d go. Now as to details. Have
you any idea where to begin to look?”</p>

<p>The boys hadn’t, and said so, but they had, in
times past, gone off on quests with even more
slender clews to work on, so they were not dismayed
now. They said they would need a day to
stock up the motorship for a long voyage, and get
plenty of gasolene aboard. Then, too, they
would have to send word of their intentions to
their folks.</p>

<p>“Well, start as soon as you can,” urged the
president, and they said they would. In spite of
their diffidence about taking funds for expenses,
the directors insisted on it, and a substantial sum
was advanced. It was really needed, as the boys
had not brought much money with them, and provisions
were expensive.</p>

<p>They arranged to start on the following day, if
possible and agreed to keep in telegraphic touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
with the bank officials. They were to work independently
of the police.</p>

<p>There were busy times ahead for our heroes.
Hurrying back to the aviation grounds they gave
their craft a thorough overhauling, and contracted
for their supplies and stores.</p>

<p>They were ready to set sail on the afternoon of
the following day, having sent word to Cresville
of their plans.</p>

<p>“Before we leave this vicinity, we’ll just stop off
at the bank, and see if there is any news,” said
Jerry, as they flew up from the aviation grounds.</p>

<p>They landed on the roof of the bank building
row, partly because that was the best place, and
partly to show that it had been perfectly feasible
for the robbers to do so. A big crowd watched
them.</p>

<p>“Have you any news before we leave?” asked
Jerry of Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>“Not any,” he said. “You’ll have to depend
on yourselves, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>As he spoke a messenger came in with a telegram.
Idly the president opened it. As he did
so an expression of surprise came over his face.</p>

<p>“Listen to this, boys!” he exclaimed. “There
is news! This is from one of our private detectives.
He says: ‘Strangers in this town two days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
ago, passing twenty dollar gold pieces. May be
a clew.’ You know some gold pieces were taken
from our vault,” the president went on. “This
may be of some value to you.”</p>

<p>“What town is that from?” asked Jerry eagerly.</p>

<p>“Newton; in this state,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll head for Newton,” cried the tall
lad. “Come on, fellows!”</p>

<p>A little later the motor boys were once more on
the wing, on the trail of the bank robbers.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>AFTER BROWN AND BLACK</small></h2>


<p>Newton, as they had learned from a hasty inquiry
just before they started, making their flight
as the robbers had, from the roof of the bank, was
a fairly large city about two hundred miles from
Harmolet. It lay in a westerly direction, and so
far that fitted in with the plans of Professor
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“First we’ll hear what Halwell, the private detective,
has to say,” decided Jerry. “He may be
able to give us a clew. If there were men in
Newton, passing twenty dollar gold pieces right
after the robbery, they were probably Brown and
Black.”</p>

<p>“Or Noddy and Bill,” put in Ned, who persisted
in his theory.</p>

<p>“Have your own way,” spoke Jerry with a
smile. “At any rate we’ll see what the detective
has to say. Of course many persons may have
twenty dollar gold pieces, but perhaps these men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
also passed big bills, and there were a number of
them taken from the bank vault.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>Comet</i> was making good time
in the direction of Newton.</p>

<p>They sighted the church spires of that place
shortly after dinner, and their descent into that
quiet city was a great sensation. Every boy,
nearly all the girls, and a good proportion of the
men and women were on hand when our heroes
came down, for an airship was a rarity in that part
of the country.</p>

<p>“And yet, if the bank robbers were here in one,
spending money, I shouldn’t think the folks would
be so curious about ours,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“Maybe the burglars left their craft somewhere
out in the woods, and came in on foot,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ll find out from Detective Halwell,” decided
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Where will we locate him?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I told President Carter to wire him that we’d
call on him at his hotel—the Mansion House,”
went on the tall lad. “As soon as we fix things
here so the boys won’t meddle, we’ll go and——”</p>

<p>“I’ll stay here and guard the craft,” interrupted
the professor.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you won’t go off after the flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
frog, or something like that?” asked Jerry half
jokingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” the professor earnestly assured him.
“This section of the country is too much built-up
to expect to find the frog here. Of course if I see
a rare insect anywhere near the airship I’ll get it.
But I won’t go so far away but what I can guard
her.”</p>

<p>The boys left with that understanding, and as
they started for the hotel they looked back to see
their scientific friend gravely pacing the deck of the
<i>Comet</i>, about which was gathered a curious crowd.</p>

<p>Detective Halwell was located at the hotel, and
the boys were just in time to catch him, for he
was about to go out to meet them.</p>

<p>“I heard of your arrival,” he said. “I got Mr.
Carter’s message, and I was expecting you. Then
I heard of the airship, and I knew it must be you.
Glad to meet you. Now how much of this case
do you know, and what can I do for you?”</p>

<p>Jerry quickly put the detective in possession of
the facts already known to my readers. In turn
the tall lad asked:</p>

<p>“Did the robbers actually come here in their
airship? If so can you describe them to us, for
we don’t know for sure whether it was Noddy and
Bill Berry, or Brown and Black.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m sure in my own mind,” interrupted Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s going to be hard to tell,” went
on the private detective. “From what I can
learn it was a middle-aged man who passed the
twenty dollar gold pieces by which I got the clew.
Now the best plan would be to go to the person
who changed the money and have him describe
this man. Then perhaps you could tell which one
it was of the four you suspect.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” declared Jerry. “Who changed
the gold piece?”</p>

<p>“It was a man who keeps a little hotel on a
country road leading in to this place,” replied the
detective. “The way I happened to hear of it
was this. I’d been sent here by President Carter
you see, to pick up any clews I could. Naturally
I made inquiries, and the other morning I heard
that the hotel clerk here had a twenty dollar gold
piece, and was doubtful whether or not it was
genuine. I have had some experience in counterfeiting
cases, so I looked at it.</p>

<p>“I never saw any better money—it was Uncle
Sam’s kind all right, and I asked him where he
got it. He said the night clerk had taken it in,
and as I was on the alert for anything like that,
I kept on with my inquiries until I found that the
money had been paid in by this hotel keeper I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
speak of—Hardy his name is. He came to town
to do some buying, and stopped here for his meal.</p>

<p>“Naturally I went after Hardy, but so far I
haven’t been able to locate him. He hasn’t been
back home since he changed the money here.”</p>

<p>“Does that strike you as being suspicious?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the detective, “for Hardy is well
known hereabouts, and is considered honest. I’ve
found out that he’s visiting relatives and expects to
be back in his hotel to-day.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s take a run out there. We can go
in the <i>Comet</i> if it’s far,” said Jerry eagerly.</p>

<p>“It’s not far enough,” said Mr. Halwell, “and
besides it would create too much talk if we descended
in an airship. In a case like this the less
talk you stir up the better. If the burglars don’t
know that we’re so close on their trail they won’t
be in such a hurry to move on. We’ll go out in
an auto. They’re common enough.”</p>

<p>They found Mr. Hardy, the hotel keeper, to
be an elderly man, of a genial disposition. He
had just returned from a three-days’ visit to relatives,
and was very willing to talk.</p>

<p>“I did break the twenty dollar gold piece,” he
admitted, “but I never thought it would make
such a rumpus. You see this is the way it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
I was sitting all alone here one evening, a few
nights ago, let me see it was on Tuesday——”</p>

<p>“The night of the robbery!” interrupted Jerry.</p>

<p>“So I’ve been told,” went on Mr. Hardy.
“Perhaps I shouldn’t have said evening, for it was
past midnight when I got ready to lock up and go
to bed, trade being dull. I was at the front door
when I heard a racket over head like when there’s
a sharp clap of thunder—you know, one of those
close-by ones, that sound like whips snapping. I
was quite surprised, for the stars were out, and
there wasn’t a sign of a storm. The noise passed
away in a second, but it gave me quite a start, and
I stayed by the front door a matter of several
minutes, but I couldn’t see anything.</p>

<p>“I was going on with my locking up, and was
just ready to put out the last light, when I heard
a knock on the door. That startled me too, for
I hadn’t heard any rig drive up, nor any auto
puffing, and this place is rather far out for people
to walk to. I didn’t like the thing at all, but as
I’m here to do business I went to the door. There
stood two men——”</p>

<p>“Not a man and a young fellow?” interrupted
Ned eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, two men, rather middle-aged men. They
were dressed like autoists, and I was rather surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
at that, for I couldn’t see any car. They
apologized for coming in so late, and they asked
me if they could get a meal—anything cold—said
they’d pay well for it.</p>

<p>“I didn’t like to bother at that time of night,
as all my help had gone to bed, but I like to be
accommodating, so I told ’em to come in. I asked
’em where their machine was, and they said they
had a slight accident and had left it down the
road. I asked ’em what kind of an auto it was,
and how badly it was broken, for my son’s a
machinist, and handy with tools. I thought I
might get him some work, but they said they
could fix it themselves, and one of ’em made a
funny sort of remark.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“He said they had broken one of the guy wires
on the warping wing tips,” replied Mr. Hardy.
“That was the first auto I ever heard of having
wings, and I didn’t ask any more questions for
fear they were making game of me.</p>

<p>“To make a long story short I got ’em a meal,
and they tossed me a twenty dollar gold piece
when they were through. I gave ’em change and
they hurried out into the darkness. I listened for
some time, but I couldn’t hear any auto chugging
off, so I went to bed. That’s how I got the gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
piece, and I was so suspicious of it that I changed
it the first chance I got. But I told the Newton
hotel clerk about it, and I said if it turned out
bad to let me know, and I’d make it right. I
thought maybe that’s what you had come out here
for.”</p>

<p>“No, it was a genuine gold piece all right,” answered
the detective.</p>

<p>“But what made you suspicious of it?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Because of the way those men acted. I didn’t
like their looks at all.”</p>

<p>“Can you describe them?” inquired Ned
eagerly. Then in a low voice he added to Jerry:
“You know Noddy is big enough to be taken for
a man.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed the tall lad. “Listen
to what he says.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I can describe the men better
than to say that they seemed suspicious of every
one,” said Mr. Hardy. “As they ate they kept
shifting their gaze all around, as if they were
afraid of some one coming in unexpectedly.
They both had sharp eyes, were of dark complexion
and were well dressed. One of them
had his hand tied up in a handkerchief and when
I asked him if he’d hurt it in the auto accident he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
said no at first, and then, as quick as a flash, he
said he had. So I thought that was queer.</p>

<p>“However, I had no complaint coming, and I’m
glad the money was all right. Now, does this
description fit in with what you want?”</p>

<p>“It does!” declared Jerry. “I’m positive the
men were Brown and Black, and that they robbed
the bank.”</p>

<p>“And I guess I’ve been wrong in thinking it was
Noddy,” admitted Ned. “Still what about the
rag on the statue, and that suspicious talk?”</p>

<p>“We’ll consider that later,” replied Jerry.
“This clears the atmosphere, so to speak, and we
know who we’re after. Now to get on the trail
of Brown and Black, who undoubtedly were in
this vicinity with their airship.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I think,” said the detective.
“I’ll ask you to keep quiet about this, Mr.
Hardy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure.”</p>

<p>“Now for further clews,” went on Jerry. “I’m
going to have a look to see if we can find where
they landed in the biplane when they came here
for their midnight supper.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>THE LONELY FARMHOUSE</small></h2>


<p>Regarding this place of landing Mr. Hardy
could give the boys and the detective no clew.
He could only point out the direction taken by the
men when they left his hotel, and that was down
the main country road. He said he had soon lost
them in the darkness.</p>

<p>“And I didn’t see which way they came, so I
can’t even tell you that,” said the innkeeper.
“But they were surely two suspicious men if I
ever saw any.”</p>

<p>“Could you get any line on their conversation?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, for they talked in whispers when I was
around. I did hear ’em speak about the broken
wing tip, or something like that, but I didn’t take
any stock in it. I never dreamed of an airship.
I was thinking of an auto all the while.”</p>

<p>“They were in an airship all right,” declared
the tall lad. “And as they would have to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
quite a level place on which to land and get a
start from again, we’ll look for that. Come on,
we’ll get back to the <i>Comet</i>.”</p>

<p>They rose high in the air, and circled about the
country looking for the most favorable spot near
the hotel of Mr. Hardy, where it was likely an
air ship would have landed.</p>

<p>“Yet as it was night, they couldn’t have had
much choice fellows,” spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“Especially with a broken warping wing,”
added Ned.</p>

<p>“That last may have been only talk,” declared
Jerry. “Brown and Black are sharp enough for
that. Besides, with a powerful search light, such
as they carried on their machine the first time we
saw it, they could pick out a clearing in the trees.”</p>

<p>“There’s a clearing down there now,” remarked
the stout lad, pointing to an opening in
the forest. It was the first large one they had
sighted, and it was at once decided to drop down
to it.</p>

<p>But they got no clews there. The glade was
carpeted with long green grass, and even if an
airship had landed there the marks of the wheels
would scarcely have made an impression. Or,
if there had been such marks, the wind would soon
have effaced them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Try again,” suggested Jerry, as they got ready
to rise as a balloon, for there was hardly room
enough to manipulate the <i>Comet</i> as an aeroplane.</p>

<p>The rest of that day they circled about, descending
into several clearings in the hope of coming
upon the one where Brown and Black had temporarily
left their machine. But it was of no use.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better get back to my hotel,” announced
the detective, as night came on. “I can’t
do anything more for you boys, and I want to
wire a report to Mr. Carter. There’s no use of
me staying in Newton any longer, for it’s evident
now that Brown and Black are far away.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so far that I doubt if we ever catch
them,” remarked Ned dubiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes we will,” exclaimed Jerry confidently.
“We’ll not give up yet. We’ll keep on going
west, for I believe that’s where we’ll find them.”</p>

<p>“And that’s where we’ll get my flying frog,”
put in the professor.</p>

<p>Night saw the boys heading due west in their
craft, the detective having alighted on the outskirts
of the town, to make his way back to his
hotel. He wished them all success.</p>

<p>“We’ll travel all night,” decided Jerry to his
chums, “for I believe those men will make long
flights, and it’s no use looking for them within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
several hundred miles of this place. They’d want
to put as great a distance as possible between
themselves and Harmolet.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned, who was now converted
to the views of his two chums. “We’ll
keep on until daylight, and then go down and
make inquiries as to whether or not any airships
have been seen lately.”</p>

<p>The hours of darkness passed without incident,
and when morning came the boys found themselves
over a small country town. They were
flying low enough so that the craft was speedily
made out by some early risers. The word quickly
went around, and soon there was a good-sized
crowd gazing earnestly upward.</p>

<p>“Shall we go down?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Might as well,” decided Ned.</p>

<p>But their anxious inquiries resulted in nothing.
There had been no signs of any other airship, and
theirs was the first the inhabitants of the town had
ever seen. Nor had any one heard the noise of
the motors of one of the craft passing onward in
the night.</p>

<p>When they were ready to start again, Professor
Snodgrass, as usual, was not on hand. They
made a search for him, and found him on the bank
of the mill pond, industriously catching frogs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
his net. He had engaged half a dozen enthusiastic
boys, promising that whoever found the flying
frog would get five dollars. The boys had
dozens of the hapless creatures in tin cans, but all
proved to be of the ordinary kind.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to look farther west,” admitted
the scientist with a sigh, as he accompanied
the boys back to the air ship. “Though
when I saw those insects I thought sure I’d have
my frog. However, I’m on the right track, I’m
positive of that.”</p>

<p>“I wish we were just as positive,” remarked
Jerry, as he and Ned started the gas machine, and
sent the <i>Comet</i> aloft again.</p>

<p>Once more on the wing, the airship made rapid
progress through space. The boys swept about
in great circles, now scanning the sky dome with
powerful glasses for a possible sight of the <i>Silver
Star</i>, and again descending to some quiet country
town to make inquiries. They avoided the big
cities, since they argued that Brown and Black, in
their efforts to escape observation, would do the
same thing.</p>

<p>But as the days passed, and they were no nearer
the trail of the thieves, the confidence of even the
optimistic Jerry began to wane. Still he had no
thought of giving up. The boys took a lesson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
from Professor Snodgrass, who, though disappointed
many times in finding his flying frog, always
approached every new pond full of confidence.</p>

<p>“I’ll get it yet!” he declared sturdily.</p>

<p>“And we’ll get Brown and Black!” asserted
Jerry.</p>

<p>It was nearly a week since they had set out
from Harmolet. In that time they had communicated
with President Carter several times, but only
to say that they were still on the trail. In turn
the bank president had wired that there were no
new developments at his end. The boys had telegraphed
to their folks, and had received messages
and greetings in return.</p>

<p>Toward the close of a warm, sultry afternoon,
when they were sailing over a lonely stretch of
country, Jerry called to Ned to look at the barometer.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s up?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“It feels like a storm, and if one’s coming I
think we’d better go down and wait until it’s over.
Is the mercury falling?”</p>

<p>“By Jove! It is going down,” reported the
lad. “I guess we’re in for it.”</p>

<p>A little later there was noticed a bank of dark
and angry-looking clouds in the west, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
them came fitful flashes of lightning, while the
distant rumble of thunder could be heard.</p>

<p>“Better go down,” advised Bob. “It’s going
to break soon.”</p>

<p>“I was waiting until I saw a little better place to
make a descent,” answered Jerry, peering anxiously
ahead through the gathering murkiness.
“It’s a pretty rough country here—nothing but
woods.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can stay in the air ship cabin,” retorted
Ned. “Go ahead down Jerry.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented the tall lad. He pulled
the deflecting lever, and, as he did so there was
a sharp snapping sound.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Bob in alarm.</p>

<p>“Lightning!” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“No, something broken,” declared Jerry. “It’s
a main brace, too,” he added a moment later.
“We’ll have to go down now whether we want to
or not. That brace will have to be heated, and
welded together before we can run the machinery
at full speed. Here we go!”</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> shot downward on a long slant, and
a moment later there was a vivid flash of lightning,
followed by a crashing peal of thunder.</p>

<p>The night was brilliantly illuminated for an instant,
and Bob cried out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s a house. Head for that, Jerry!”</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned had also seen, revealed in the
flash of celestial fire, a lonely farmhouse in the
midst of a little clearing. The airship had suddenly
shot over it on her downward course.</p>

<p>“That’s a good place to land!” cried Jerry
above the noise of another clap of thunder.
“Head for the barn yard!”</p>

<p>An instant later there came a deluge of rain,
and in the midst of it the airship came to the
earth rather suddenly, for a gust of wind upset
Jerry’s calculations with the rudder.</p>

<p>As the <i>Comet</i> came to rest, after shooting
across the yard in front of the barn, a man came
running from the farmhouse.</p>

<p>“By Peter! Another one of the critters!” he
cried. “Hey, you fellers! Come on in the
house! Come in the house!”</p>

<p>“No, we’ll go in the barn, after we fasten down
the ship!” shouted Jerry.</p>

<p>“Come in the house I tell you! Keep out of
that barn! Come in the house!” And the
farmer who seemed greatly excited over something,
fairly grasped Jerry by the arm, as the
widow’s son alighted from the ship, and led him
toward the house.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>QUEER ACTIONS</small></h2>


<p>Ned and Bob were already out in the rain, getting
ready to make the anchor ropes fast to the
nearest firm objects. They gazed somewhat
curiously after Jerry, wondering where he was
going with the farmer. Professor Snodgrass,
after seeing that all his specimen boxes were safely
put away, had come out and was helping the two
boys.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to give them a hand,” shouted Jerry
above the noise of the storm. “Can we wheel the
airship under the shed? I see you have one by
the barn.”</p>

<p>“Not that shed—the one over here,” answered
Mr. Rossmore pointing to another, somewhat removed
from the big barn. “That shed ain’t safe.
It might tumble down and smash your air machine.
Wheel it over to that other shed, and then come
in the house. Land sakes! This is a fearful
storm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>He made another grab for Jerry’s arm, but the
tall lad avoided the grasp, at the same time wondering
at the strange behavior of the farmer.</p>

<p>“He wants to be hospitable all right,” mused
the widow’s son, “but he takes a queer way of
showing it. Wait a minute,” he called to Bob and
Ned, “I’ll give you a hand. We’re going to put
her under the shed. I guess it’s big enough.”</p>

<p>“Bur-r-r-r-r! It’s awful wet rain!” exclaimed
Ned, as a stream of water ran down his neck.
“Who’s your friend, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Hush. I don’t know, except that his name’s
Hiram Rossmore. He wants us to come in the
house. He’s a bit queer. Here he comes.”</p>

<p>The farmer had followed Jerry as the latter
turned back toward the airship; and Mr. Rossmore,
together with the boys and Professor Snodgrass,
wheeled the <i>Comet</i> toward a big wagon
shed, which fortunately proved large enough to
accommodate the craft. Not that rain would
spoil it, but in a terrific thunder storm, such as
was now in progress, and with a stiff wind blowing,
there was danger of damage to the somewhat
frail machine.</p>

<p>It was soon under shelter and well secured with
ropes, while Jerry went inside to make a quick
inspection of the broken brace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“It will need a blacksmith shop to repair it,” he
reported to his chums.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, can ye come in th’ house now?” asked
Mr. Rossmore, as he stood under the shed, at the
side of the motorship. “This is a bigger shebang
than the other—I mean it’s the biggest one I’ve
ever seen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you’ve seen one before?” asked
Jerry with a quick and warning glance at his
chums.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw one on exhibition at our county
fair,” was the disappointing answer. “It wasn’t
so big as this, and was some different.”</p>

<p>“We are looking for an airship that belongs to—er—well,
to some men we know,” spoke Jerry.
“It may be sailing around here. We’re looking
for it.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I guess you won’t find it here,” said the
man, with rather an uneasy laugh. “Now come
on in the house and dry off. I live all alone exceptin’
for the hired man, and he’s gone to town
to-day, so we’ll have the place to ourselves.
Come on in the house. That barn’s dangerous in
a thunderstorm—in fact it’s dangerous most any
time. It’s likely to fall. I wouldn’t go too near
it if I was you.”</p>

<p>Jerry looked at the barn in question. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
seemed well made, and solid, being in good repair.
He looked at Mr. Rossmore. The
farmer was glancing anxiously about, as though to
assure himself that all four airship travelers were
following him. Then, as if apparently satisfied
on this point, he hurriedly led the way through the
pelting rain to the farmhouse.</p>

<p>Jerry and the boys looked about them. Save
for the clearing in which the house and other
structures stood they were surrounded by a great
forest. It was a very lonesome place.</p>

<p>“Did you have some accident?” asked the man,
as he opened the door of a spacious farmhouse,
and ushered them in.</p>

<p>“Yes, we broke one of the main braces of the
motor,” answered Jerry. “Is there a blacksmith
shop around here? Or have you a portable forge
we could use?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t any. But there’s a shop about
ten miles away. You might go there after the
storm is over. But stay in the house until it is.
You see I come here for solitude. I don’t have
much of a farm. This was a big one once, but it’s
mostly growed up to second growth now, and I
sell some lumber. I don’t farm it.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty nice place for a bachelor,” observed
Jerry, looking around, and noting that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
house showed a woman’s care. There were many
evidences that other hands than those of men had
to do with the place.</p>

<p>“Oh, I ain’t a bachelor,” was the quick answer.
“My wife’s gone to visit some relations, and I let
the hired man have a vacation too. So I’m all
alone. But make yourselves to home. Peel off
your wet things if you want to. I’ll get some
blankets you can wrap up in, and there’s a good
fire in the kitchen. Then I’ll get you something
to eat.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be good!” exclaimed Bob, so earnestly
that his chums laughed.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t mind him,” apologized Jerry to
the farmer. “It’s his one failing to be always
hungry.”</p>

<p>“Better tell some of your own,” murmured the
stout lad.</p>

<p>Mr. Rossmore laughed and left the room, soon
returning with a pile of blankets. The boys and
the professor, going out in front of the big kitchen
stove, divested themselves of their outer garments,
and were soon warm and comfortable,
while their wet clothes were drying before the
oven.</p>

<p>“Now, for a meal,” went on the farmer. “I’ll
do my best for you. I just cooked some chicken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
so I’ll warm it up.”</p>

<p>Bob’s eyes sparkled in anticipation. They were
left to themselves for a few minutes while they
heard Mr. Rossmore rummaging about down in
the cellar, evidently after the victuals.</p>

<p>“Does anything strike you as peculiar?” asked
Jerry of his chums, as he noted that Professor
Snodgrass was trying to capture a fly that was
buzzing on the window pane.</p>

<p>“About what?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“About this farmer—and this place.”</p>

<p>“It looks comfortable,” remarked Bob. “Comfortable,
and—and a good place to stay. He’s
going to feed us well, too!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all you think of, Chunky! I mean
doesn’t Mr. Rossmore strike you as rather odd?”</p>

<p>“It was kind of funny, him not wanting you to
go out in the barn,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what I mean. Now I think——” and
Jerry drew closer to his companions.</p>

<p>But what Jerry thought he did not at that
moment say, for at that instant there sounded outside,
and above the noise of the rain on the roof,
a loud cry.</p>

<p>“That came from the barn!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure!” assented Ned.</p>

<p>Their voices were silenced in a terrific clap of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
thunder that followed a vivid flash. Professor
Snodgrass jumped back from the window in some
alarm.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Jerry pointing outside where the
rain was coming down in torrents. What he saw,
and what the others saw was Mr. Rossmore rushing
toward the barn at full speed—toward the
barn against which he had warned our heroes.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<small>THE WOUNDED MEN</small></h2>


<p>“Well, what do you make of that?” asked
Ned, as they watched their host disappear inside
the big structure.</p>

<p>“Didn’t that call come from there?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure,” assented Jerry. “And Mr. Rossmore
ran out there as soon as he heard it. He must
have gone from the cellar by the outside door.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he ran out to the barn
for in the rain?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Because he has something there that needs
his attention,” decided Jerry. “We heard the
yell, out he rushed, and he went suddenly. Whatever
he has out there he doesn’t want us to see;
that’s evident.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see if we can’t discover it,” suggested
Ned. “I don’t like the looks of things around
here. Shall we tell Mr. Rossmore why we’re
looking for the other airship, Jerry?”</p>

<p>The tall lad shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not?” persisted Ned. “Don’t you recall
what he said when he caught sight of us?—something
about it being ‘another one of th’ critters.’
That looks suspicious.”</p>

<p>“There are a lot of things that look suspicious,”
agreed the widow’s son, “but we can’t solve them
that way. We must be as foxy as this farmer is,
that is, if he is trying to play foxy; keep our eyes
open, listen with both ears, and we’ll see what
happens. Meanwhile say as little as possible, let
him think we are falling in with his ideas, and he
may betray himself. Here he comes back. Don’t
let him see that we’ve been watching.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rossmore must have known that his trip
to the barn had been observed, for instead of
coming in through the cellar, the way he had gone
out, he came in by the back entry of the kitchen.</p>

<p>“I had to go out in the barn—I’ve got a sick
horse there,” he explained. “Maybe you boys
heard him neighing.”</p>

<p>“We heard some noise out that way, but the
storm made such a racket we couldn’t be sure,”
spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was my horse. He’s in a bad way.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think you’d keep him in a barn
that was in danger of tumbling down,” remarked
Ned, with a wink at his chums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know as the barn is going to fall
right away. Still it’s best to be on the safe side
with folks. Now I’ll go ahead and get up the
victuals. If you hear any more noises from the
barn—well, don’t go out there, that’s all. That
horse might get loose and hurt you.”</p>

<p>“We won’t,” promised Jerry. “Not in this
rain.”</p>

<p>For it was pouring harder than ever, though the
thunder and lightning were not so severe. Mr.
Rossmore was drenched by his trip to the barn,
but he did not seem to mind. In a short time he
had set out a substantial meal, Bob offering to
help, of which services the farmer availed himself.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there any blacksmith shop nearer than
ten miles?” asked Jerry, after the meal. “That’s
too far to go in our airship with a broken brace.
If we can’t find one nearer we’ll have to make
temporary repairs ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Well, it might not be quite ten miles,” said the
farmer, in what the boys thought was an eager
tone. “In fact perhaps it isn’t more than three or
four. I guess you could get there all right.
When are you going to start?”</p>

<p>“In the morning,” answered Jerry, for it was
now unusually dark, because of the heavy clouds
overhead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, then you’re calculating on staying here all
night,” spoke the farmer. “Well, now, I’m sorry,
but you see I’ve only got one bed—that is I’ve got
more, but they’ve been taken down to be painted,
and they’re not dry. The bed clothes have gone
to the wash woman’s too. In fact that’s why my
wife went away. We’re sort of house cleaning,
and the only bed fit to use is a couch I sleep on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we wouldn’t think of troubling you!” interposed
Jerry. “We’ll go aboard the <i>Comet</i>
and sleep there. We always do. We have
plenty of bunks.” The more he saw of the queer
man the less he liked the idea of spending the
night under his roof.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you’ve got your own accommodations
it’s all right,” went on Mr. Rossmore. “I can
give you plenty of victuals.”</p>

<p>“That’s good!” exclaimed Bob, involuntarily.</p>

<p>“We have plenty of things to eat, too,” went
on Jerry, who felt a growing distrust of the
farmer, “though we are much obliged for what
you have given us. We’ll go aboard our craft
now, I think, and in the morning we’ll see if we
can get to the smithy.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s quite a bad break,” remarked Jerry
a little later when, as they were all on the airship,
he and his chums had made another inspection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the fracture. “There must have been a flaw in
the steel. I don’t believe we’d better risk going
on to the blacksmith shop.”</p>

<p>“What will you do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Make a new brace here. We can build a sort
of forge out of stones and heat the metal enough
I guess. I can make a temporary repair, that
will last until we can get to a machine shop.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll stay on at this place a little longer,
eh?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, until to-morrow afternoon anyhow.”</p>

<p>“That will give us a chance to do some investigating,”
decided the merchant’s son. “I want to
see inside that barn.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Jerry, “but we’ll have to be
careful how we go about it. I guess Mr. Rossmore
will be on the lookout.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t go to bed with the chickens, at any
rate,” observed Bob. “He’s got a light in the
kitchen, and seems to be moving about, if the
shadow on the curtain goes for anything.”</p>

<p>It was evident that the farmer was up and
about, for the moving shadow was visible until
nearly midnight. By this time the storm was
over, and our heroes, who had been waiting up
for a chance to make at least a tour outside the
barn, had about decided to go to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry could not get to sleep, though he was soon
made aware by the heavy breathing of Bob and
Ned that they were slumbering. But the tall lad
was thinking of many things. At last, after tossing
restlessly on his bed for some time, he got up
and partly dressed.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll take a turn outside,” he thought.
“Maybe I can get in the barn now, if that suspicious
farmer is asleep.”</p>

<p>But Jerry’s hopes were doomed to disappointment.
He had no sooner gone a few paces toward
the forbidden barn than a hail came from
the now darkened house.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” called the voice of the farmer.</p>

<p>“It’s me—Jerry Hopkins,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Oh—do you want anything—any of you boys
sick?”</p>

<p>“No, I—I was just looking out—I couldn’t
sleep. I’m going back now.”</p>

<p>“Oh—all right,” was the noncommital answer.</p>

<p>“No use trying that—he’s on guard,” mused
Jerry as he got back into bed. “I’ll have to
wait.”</p>

<p>The tall lad told his chums the next morning
of his experience, and they agreed that there was
something very strange about the matter. They
got an early breakfast in the <i>Comet</i>, and at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
set to work making a temporary forge to weld a
new brace.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to the blacksmith’s,”
remarked the farmer, as he saw what they were
doing.</p>

<p>“We concluded it wouldn’t be safe,” replied
Jerry. “No objection to making a fire here, is
there? We’ll keep it inside the stones, and not
set the barn afire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that—that’s all right,” said the farmer
with an obvious effort. “But don’t go in—that
horse is dangerous.”</p>

<p>All that morning the boys worked hard at the
new brace. They had it nearly finished and were
getting ready to attach it. In the meanwhile
Mr. Rossmore had been hovering about them,
never very far away, and always keeping between
them and the barn, which structure he entered
several times, taking with him bottles of medicine.</p>

<p>“We’ll never get in there,” grumbled Ned.</p>

<p>“Take it easy,” advised Jerry. And then, most
unexpectedly, their chance came. A man who
was driving past in the road called to Mr. Rossmore,
who was hoeing in the garden near his
house. The farmer, after a quick glance at the
boys, who were busy over their forge, hastened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the fence, and soon was in earnest talk with the
horseman.</p>

<p>“Now’s our chance!” exclaimed Ned. “Jerry,
you slip over to the barn. Rossmore can’t see you
from where he stands. I’ll hang your coat on
this stake, and Bob and I will crowd up around it
so it will look as if all three of us are here at the
fire. Go ahead and be quick about it.”</p>

<p>Jerry saw that the plan was a good one. With
a quick glance to assure himself that Mr. Rossmore
was still at the fence, the tall lad hurried toward
the barn. The big front doors were locked,
but Jerry ran around to the back, and there found
a portal open. It was the work of but an instant
to slip inside.</p>

<p>At first, coming in out of the bright light, he
could see nothing. Then his eyes became accustomed
to the darkness. He moved forward,
and as his feet echoed over the rough boards the
lad was startled by a call:</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” asked a voice.</p>

<p>“Where are you?” inquired Jerry in turn. He
heard some sharp whispers, and then, before he
could move, a door was thrown open. It gave a
view of a large, light harness room, but it was
not the sight of horse trappings that attracted
Jerry’s attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Lying on a cot in the room was a man whose
head was done up in bandages, while holding the
door open was another wounded man leaning on a
crutch. The latter caught one view of Jerry, and
then the door was slammed shut with a bang. At
the same instant there sounded that loud cry that
Jerry had heard once before. His blood was
chilled as the echoes vibrated through the old
barn.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>THE CAPTURE</small></h2>


<p>For one instant Jerry Hopkins was almost inclined
to believe that what he had seen was part
of a dream. Then as the nerve-racking yells continued
to vibrate through the barn, he knew that
they came from real men.</p>

<p>And the faces of those men!</p>

<p>It was like some vision of the night. He
racked his brain for a remembrance.</p>

<p>“Where have I seen them before—those
wounded men? I’m sure——” He paused irresolutely.</p>

<p>His musing was interrupted by the breathless
entrance of Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“Jerry!” cried the stout lad. “Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” gasped Ned. “Was
that you calling, Jerry?”</p>

<p>They could not see him at first, coming in from
the bright sunlight, but in a few seconds they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
could make out the form of their tall chum, as he
stood staring at the closed door of the harness
room whence came those terrific cries.</p>

<p>“I have it!” fairly shouted Jerry. “Now I
know who they are! Boys we’ve found the bank
robbers!”</p>

<p>“Found the bank robbers?” repeated Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes. Brown and Black! They’re in there—in
that harness room! I had a glimpse of them.
They’re both wounded. They must have met
with an accident. They can’t get away. We’ve
found them!”</p>

<p>“Now for the ten thousand dollars reward!”
cried Ned.</p>

<p>“And this is why that farmer didn’t want us to
come in the barn,” went on Jerry. “He had these
men hidden here!”</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken when the farmer in question
came fairly bursting into the barn, entering
from the big main doors. Mr. Rossmore was
greatly excited. He saw the boys at once.</p>

<p>“Here! What does this mean?” he cried.
“Didn’t I tell you to keep out of here? Now get
out at once and stay out. Clear out of my place!
Get away, do you hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we hear, but we’re not going,” said
Jerry calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“We came to see that sick horse,” spoke Ned,
sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Get out!” cried the farmer angrily, advancing
toward them, with a threatening gesture.</p>

<p>“Don’t move, boys,” came the advice from
Jerry. “We’ll have this thing out. Go call the
professor, Bob,” for Mr. Snodgrass had been
catching bugs in a field near where our heroes
were working when Jerry decided to investigate
the mystery of the barn.</p>

<p>“Look here! What does this mean?” blustered
Mr. Rossmore, as Bob slipped out of the
small door.</p>

<p>“It means just this,” went on Jerry, while another
of the strange cries, though not so loud as
the previous ones, echoed through the structure,
“it means that you are concealing here two men
who robbed the Harmolet National Bank of two
hundred and ten thousand dollars, and carried it
away in an airship! It means that Brown and
Black—to give them the names they go under—are
in that harness room, and it means that we
have discovered them. It also means that we are
going to cause their arrest, and that if you interfere
with the course of justice you lay yourself
liable to a charge of aiding criminals. That’s
what it means!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry spoke with great firmness, and the attitude
of himself and Ned was such that the farmer
was cowed.</p>

<p>“Rob—robbers!” he stammered. “Two hundred
and ten thousand dollars! Why that’s nonsense!
Those men are not thieves.”</p>

<p>“What are they then?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“One of them has been wrongly confined in a
lunatic asylum,” went on the farmer. “He is Mr.
Hendrix, and the other man is Mr. Clark, a friend
of his. Mr. Clark managed to get his friend out
of the asylum, and was taking him away in an airship.
They got over my place and had an accident.
They both fell from the airship into a
tree, and were badly hurt. They appealed to me
for help, and offered me a large sum if I would
conceal them, so that they would not be captured
by the asylum authorities. The asylum people
want to keep Mr. Hendrix in their possession so
they can get his valuable property, but his friend
is trying to prevent this. That is why I am concealing
them, and why I did not want you to go
near the barn. I deceived you, I admit, but I
cannot believe that they are robbers. If I had
known that they were——”</p>

<p>“Suppose you come in that room with us, and
let us ask them a few questions, about the box of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
strange tools they carried on their airship,” suggested
Jerry. “I think that will convince you.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” agreed the farmer. “I never
would have believed such nice gentlemen could be
robbers. They told such a straight story. And
I saw them fall from their airship. So when I
saw you arrive in yours I thought you were from
the asylum after them, and I tried to get you away
from the barn.”</p>

<p>“Just confront them with us, and we’ll soon
prove that the story they told you was all made-up,”
said Jerry eagerly.</p>

<p>“All right, come on,” agreed Mr. Rossmore.
“I don’t want to do nothing wrong.”</p>

<p>Again there came that terrifying yell.</p>

<p>“My gracious! What’s that?” gasped the
professor.</p>

<p>“That’s Mr. Hendrix—the supposed lunatic.
He is badly hurt, and delirious from pain,” explained
Mr. Rossmore. “His friend and I have
to give him quieting medicine whenever he gets
one of those fits. That’s why I ran here. He is
suffering greatly.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t let even a bank burglar suffer,”
said the scientist, to whom Jerry quickly explained
what the farmer had told them. “I’ll
take a look at him, and you boys can make sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
you are not mistaken in your identity. Then we
can decide on what to do. They can’t get away.”</p>

<p>With the farmer leading the way the boys and
the professor entered the harness room. If any
other confirmation was needed that the suspicions
of our heroes were true, it came when Clark, <em>alias</em>
Black, exclaimed as he caught sight of the boys:</p>

<p>“Well, the jig is up!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it is,” said Jerry grimly. “You
made a bold effort, but fate was against you.
Where is the money?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t got it,” growled the least injured
of the two burglars.</p>

<p>“Haven’t got it?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s in the airship. I might as well tell
the truth now.”</p>

<p>“In the airship? And where is that?” demanded
the professor.</p>

<p>“How should I know?” snapped Black, while
his companion tossed feverishly on the narrow cot.
“We both fell out when it nearly turned turtle,
then it righted itself again, and sailed off over
the forest, the engine set at full speed. It’ll run
until the gasolene gives out, or until it’s wrecked,
I suppose. But we’ll have to have a doctor for
him,” and he nodded at his companion. “He’s
getting worse. The game’s up. I’m ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
take my medicine. One of my legs is broken, and
I’m hurt inside. Oh, how I suffer! We did rob
the bank. I confess. We laid our plans a long
time ahead and thought if we used an aeroplane
no one could trace us.”</p>

<p>“He must have a doctor, and that soon,” declared
the professor. “He is in a bad state; indeed
both are. Boys, word must be sent to the
authorities at once, and these men must be taken
to a hospital under police guard.”</p>

<p>“And to think they told me they were escaping
from an asylum,” murmured Mr. Rossmore. “I
can’t get over it!”</p>

<p>“Was it true what they said about the airship
going on after they fell out?” asked Jerry eagerly.</p>

<p>“It was,” replied the farmer. “It went sailing
over the trees like a big bird.”</p>

<p>“Which way?” asked Ned, for he was thinking
of the treasure on board.</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Which way did it go?” went on the tall lad,
turning to the robber who went by the name of
Black or Clark.</p>

<p>“Hey?” The man gazed almost stupidly at
Jerry. There was a strange light in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Which way did the airship go?” repeated the
lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“It went to Africa,” was the unexpected answer.
“The engine was set to carry it to Borneo,
and from there we are to pick up the Japanese
Mikado and go on a pleasure jaunt in the Andes
mountains. We’re going to race with the condor
birds. Ha! Ha! We’ll lead a jolly life.
Pass over that juice, Bill, I’ve got the hole
drilled!” he exclaimed. “Look out now! It’s
going off! Oh, maybe we haven’t made a haul
this time.”</p>

<p>With a shriek he fell back on the cot, beside his
companion who was moaning in pain.</p>

<p>“Delirious—out of his head,” murmured Professor
Snodgrass. “I doubt if we can get any
more information from either of them right away.
They must have medical attention, and the police
must come here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go for them,” volunteered Jerry. “Ned
and I can manage the <i>Comet</i> if you and Bob will
stay here and guard them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help,” volunteered the farmer. “I’m with
you boys now.”</p>

<p>They accepted his offer. Professor Snodgrass
administered some quieting medicine to both
wounded men. A little later Ned and Jerry
started for the nearest town for a doctor and the
proper authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“And then we’ll go off after the airship treasure,”
decided Jerry.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a hard time hunting it,” declared
Ned.</p>

<p>Both robbers were in the delirium of high fever
when the doctor reached them. He at once took
charge, and the constable formally placed the
strange men under arrest as the bank robbers,
though Brown and Black of course did not realize
this. Then, being made as comfortable as possible,
they were taken in the airship to a hospital,
Mr. Rossmore remaining at his farmhouse a very
much surprised man.</p>

<p>A telegram was sent to the bank authorities telling
them of the capture, and stating that the boys
would try to recover the treasure. Then, arranging
to have the robbers sent to Harmolet for trial
as soon as they were well enough, the boys and
the professor entered the <i>Comet</i> and headed her
once more back toward the farmhouse.</p>

<p>“We’ll get the direction as nearly as we can
from Mr. Rossmore in which the <i>Silver
Star</i> disappeared after the men fell out,”
said Jerry, “and then we’ll go on a hunt. Think
of a big fortune being lost somewhere in these
woods!” and he pointed to the vast, lonely forest
below them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>TOSSED BY THE STORM</small></h2>


<p>Very little information could be obtained from
Mr. Rossmore. He was so “flustered,” as he expressed
it, from what had taken place, and so unnerved
by the thought that he had been harboring
in his barn two desperate bank robbers, that he
could hardly answer simple questions.</p>

<p>“All I know,” he said, “is that I was out in the
garden when their airship whizzed overhead. It
flopped on one side, and the men were spilled out.
They fell in a tree, or they’d have been killed instantly.
I ran to help them, so I didn’t notice
which way their machine went off.”</p>

<p>“But you must have some idea,” insisted Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, as near as I can tell it went over that
way,” and he pointed to the west. “It’s a terrible
lonesome country there. Once you get lost it’s
all up with you.”</p>

<p>“We don’t intend to get lost,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>Nothing more could be gained by questioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the farmer, and, after paying him for his hospitality
our friends looked over their craft to see
if it was in shape for another long flight.</p>

<p>The repairs made to the brace had been completed,
and the machinery was in perfect order.
There was also plenty of gasolene and provisions
and stores on board.</p>

<p>“We’ll just have to cruise about until we sight
the airship that got away from the robbers,” decided
Jerry.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose it’s floating yet; do you?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, it must have run out of gasolene some
time ago, to say nothing of being deflected downward
by the wind, and crashing into a tree. No,
we’ll have to look on the ground in the forest for
this craft.”</p>

<p>“And maybe the bank treasure isn’t on it after
all,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Maybe not, Chunky. Yet if those robbers
had it about them we’d have discovered it. And
I don’t believe they have hidden it in the barn.
Well, let’s start.”</p>

<p>All the rest of that day they cruised about in
the air, occasionally veering to the left or right,
for they could not be certain that the pilotless
<i>Silver Star</i> would keep to a straight course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“If we only knew which way the wind was
blowing at the time their airship scooted off by
herself, we might know better how to search,”
observed Bob, pausing in his work of getting
supper.</p>

<p>“Yes, and if we knew how much gasolene she
carried, we could tell how long her engine would
run, and if we knew just where she had fallen in
these woods we’d go there and find her,” added
Jerry. “But we don’t know those things, so
we’ve got to do the best we can.”</p>

<p>“I certainly hope I get a chance to look for my
flying frog,” put in the professor. “We are getting
over the region now where they are to be
found.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do the best we can for you,” promised
the tall lad.</p>

<p>On and on they went. Night came, and they
descended in a small clearing, for in the darkness
they did not want to run over the place where
the wrecked airship might be. Morning again
saw them on the wing.</p>

<p>It was about noon, when Jerry, who had paid
several anxious visits to the barometer, came
back into the pilot house where Ned was steering.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked the merchant’s son.</p>

<p>“We’re in for another storm—a worse one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
than the thunder and lightning kind we had the
time we landed at the lonely farmhouse,” replied
the tall lad. “It’s going to be a blow.”</p>

<p>“Well, can’t we weather it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. We could go down now, as
there are several clearings around us. But if we
do we may lose a chance of discovering the airship
treasure.”</p>

<p>“Then keep on,” advised Ned.</p>

<p>“The only thing is,” resumed Jerry, “that if
we get in the midst of a stiff blow we may not be
able to land when we want to, on account of the
thick trees.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to take the chance,” went
on the other. “We’ll get everything snug, and
then, when it does come on to blow, we’ll be in
shape for it.”</p>

<p>Everything loose about the airship was made
fast. Jerry and his chums, with Professor Snodgrass
to help them (for the scientist left off his
bug collecting pursuits when he saw the storm
coming up) went over the machinery, and saw
that it was in good working order. The gas container
was filled with the vapor under double
pressure, ready to be used in case of emergency.</p>

<p>Then all they could do was to wait, meanwhile
sailing slowly on, peering down through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
gathering murkiness for a sight of the disabled
biplane.</p>

<p>The storm broke with a suddenness that was
almost terrifying. It came with a dash of rain,
some thunder and lightning, and then these ceased,
while the wind blew as the boys had seldom seen
it blow before. In an instant they were tossed
skyward, and then hurled toward the earth, and
had not Jerry quickly set the rising rudder they
might have been dashed upon the tree tops.</p>

<p>The wind now became a perfect gale, and on
the wings of it they were hurled forward, almost
faster than their powerful propellers could carry
them. They were tossed hither and thither by
the storm, and only Jerry’s skill, aided as he was
by his chums, prevented a wreck in the first few
minutes of the opening blasts on the trumpet of
the storm king.</p>

<p>“Can’t you go up higher, and get away from
it?” yelled Ned into Jerry’s ear.</p>

<p>“If we do we may miss the <i>Silver Star</i>,” was
the answer. For it was not so dark but that the
white and flapping expanse of the planes of the
wrecked airship could be noticed in case the boys
sighted her.</p>

<p>Forward they were hurled, Jerry trying to keep
at about the same distance above the forest, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
finding it hard work. It was over an unbroken
woods that they were now moving. Not a clearing
was to be seen in the many miles they covered
in a short space of time.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have trouble when we want
to land to-night,” remarked the tall lad. “I
doubt if we can do it.”</p>

<p>“We can’t unless we get to a clearing,” declared
Ned.</p>

<p>“Or a lake,” added Bob.</p>

<p>With a swoop the <i>Comet</i> went sailing upward,
as a fiercer blast of the wind caught under her big
planes, and Jerry strained at the lever of the
deflecting rudder to bring her down.</p>

<p>“Give us a hand here!” he cried to his chums,
and they sprang to his side.</p>

<p>Slowly the airship was forced downward, and
then on she went on the wings of the gale,
swaying from side to side, while the wind howled
through her wire rigging as if in glee at the fate
in store for her.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>THE WRECKED AIRSHIP</small></h2>


<p>Several hours passed, and it was only by the
greatest skill that Jerry and his companions were
able to keep their craft on a level keel. Several
times she almost turned turtle, and they were in
danger of being hurled to earth as the unfortunate
bank robbers had been.</p>

<p>Night was approaching, and still the <i>Comet</i>
hurled herself forward through the heart of the
storm. Finally Jerry, who had gone to the motor
room, while Ned steered, came back to the pilot
house.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to go down,” he said. “We can’t
stand this much longer. It’s getting worse; and
besides, we can’t look for the airship in the darkness.
We’ll have to make a landing.”</p>

<p>“But how can we—in that?” and Ned pointed
to the vast expanse of black forest below them.
“We’ll be torn to pieces on the trees.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to wait until we see a comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
clear place, of course. Even then it’s
going to be risky; but we’ve got to do it. Tell
Bob to watch out for a clearing.”</p>

<p>Eagerly they all watched, while the darkness
gathered more densely. The storm had not
abated a bit, and it was now raining again, the
drops whipping against the airship almost like
hail, such was the force of the wind.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob, who had donned a rain coat, and
a rubber hat with a flap that came to his shoulders,
uttered a cry, and pointed downward and to the
left.</p>

<p>“What is it?” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“A clearing—a big place—make for it!”</p>

<p>Ned sprang to his chum’s side.</p>

<p>“A clearing!” he shouted. “That’s a lake—a
big lake! Good enough, Jerry! Head for
that. Our hydroplanes will come in useful now!”</p>

<p>It needed but a second to put the nose of the
airship in the right direction, and in a few moments
our heroes found themselves over a large
body of water in the midst of the vast and uninhabited
forest.</p>

<p>“Some waves there,” murmured Bob, and indeed
the lake was covered with whitecaps from
the wind, which was whipping their crests into
spray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“Still it’s better than landing on the trees,” replied
Jerry. “Stand by to let the hydroplanes
down, boys!”</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer to the foam-crested water
came the gallant craft. The waves could be seen
to be larger now, and even Jerry, staunch-hearted
as he was, felt a momentary sense of fear. He
had never dropped his machine on water that was
as rough as this.</p>

<p>But there was no help for it. They could not
keep on, and they must stop somewhere for the
night. So, after a glance about in order to pick
out the most sheltered spot, the tall lad yanked
the lever of the deflecting rudder over still farther.</p>

<p>“Here we go!” he cried. “Look out, boys!
Shoot the hydroplanes out when I give the word!”</p>

<p>Jerry turned off the power. The great propellers
ceased revolving. The airship was now
diving rapidly downward under her own momentum.</p>

<p>“Ready!” suddenly shouted Jerry; and Bob
and Ned pulled on the levers, folding up the
bicycle wheels, and shunting into place on the
toggle-jointed arms the hydroplanes that would
keep the <i>Comet</i> afloat.</p>

<p>The boys were hardly prepared for what followed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
for as soon as they struck the water they
were at once tossed about by the violence of the
waves, the airship being so buoyant that she was
like a chip on the lake. Up and down on the
long swells, from side to side, she was thrown
most violently.</p>

<p>“We can’t stand this!” yelled Ned. “We’ll
tear the motor from the bed-plates.”</p>

<p>“Start the water propeller,” called Jerry to
Ned and Bob, “and I’ll head for shore. Be ready
to jump out when I give the word, and haul her
up with ropes. I’ll let down the wheels as soon
as we get in shallow water.”</p>

<p>A moment later the craft was a little steadier,
for Jerry had headed her up into the eye of the
wind, and her bow instead of the side was taking
the breaking waves. Then she moved forward
toward the distant shore.</p>

<p>It was a hard fight, and one the boys never forgot.
Time and again they were in danger of
being swamped. But the gallant <i>Comet</i> struggled
on, proving herself almost as good a water navigator
as she was in the air. Then, as they neared
the shore, Bob and Ned leaped out and reached
the bank, holding long ropes attached to the airship.
Jerry dropped the bicycle wheels and a
little later the craft was pulled out on land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately this was during a lull in the gale,
or even then she might have been dashed against
the trees and wrecked. But before the blast
could resume its howling the boys and the professor
had rolled their airship up into a little
opening amid the trees, and soon it was well
lashed to the sturdy trunks, some of the wing
planes being folded over to offer less surface to
the gale.</p>

<p>“Now I guess we’re pretty snug,” remarked
Bob, as they sat in the closed cabin, and listened
to the howl of the wind and the dash of the rain
without. “I’ll get supper, and then we can sit
and talk. It was a lucky thing I saw the lake.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it was,” agreed Jerry. “For doing
that we’ll forgive you for mentioning something
to eat.”</p>

<p>“Sure, go ahead and get two suppers,” urged
Ned. “I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>The professor was observed to be putting on
a rain coat and a pair of rubber boots.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Out to look for my flying frog,” he explained.</p>

<p>The boys persuaded him to wait until morning,
and soon Bob served supper. Then, being tired
with their day in the storm, they turned in, being
almost as comfortable as if they were at home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
save only that the <i>Comet</i> trembled now and then,
as the blast shook her.</p>

<p>It stormed so all of the following day that they
did not venture up in the air, but remained anchored.
It began to clear during the afternoon,
and the professor went searching for the flying
frog, but came back at dusk without it.</p>

<p>“We’ll start in the morning,” decided Jerry
that night, “and I hope we’ll soon find what we’re
looking for.”</p>

<p>It was about noon of the next day, when they
had covered many miles over the trackless forest,
that Ned, who was in the bow, looking eagerly
through the binoculars, uttered a joyful cry.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure—but I see a big patch of white
down there. It may be the wrecked airship we’re
looking for. See, right by that clump of pines?”</p>

<p>He pointed and handed the glasses to Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s either her or a big white stone,” murmured
the tall lad.</p>

<p>“It can’t be a stone, for it flutters in the wind,”
declared Ned.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure,” advised Bob. “We’ve
been fooled before.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see what it is,” said Jerry.
“We’ll go down there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Eagerly they watched as the white patch became
bigger, for they were nearing it rapidly.
Now they could make out that it was some kind
of cloth, caught on the limbs of a tree, for it
flapped back and forth like a signal of distress.</p>

<p>“I—I guess we’ve found it at last,” murmured
Jerry hopefully.</p>

<p>“If only the treasure is there,” added Ned in
a low voice.</p>

<p>In a few seconds more they were over the object.
Just ahead of them was a little clearing
where Jerry was going to land. As the <i>Comet</i>
passed over the white object the boys looked
down. Then came a joyful cry.</p>

<p>“That’s her!” yelled Ned. “It’s their airship!”</p>

<p>For what he and the others saw, on the ground
under the white cloth, was the bent and twisted
remains of a big biplane, the engine, wings and
frame being tossed together in an almost inextricable
mass. It was the wreck of the <i>Silver
Star</i>.</p>

<p>But was the airship treasure there?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>THE AIRSHIP TREASURE—CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>“That’s the same one!”</p>

<p>“The craft Brown and Black had.”</p>

<p>“The one they ordered us away from; I can tell
by the peculiar wing tips—at least from what’s
left of ’em.”</p>

<p>Thus spoke Bob, Ned and Jerry in turn as they
stood in the little clearing where they had landed,
and viewed the airship wreck that was just on
the edge of it.</p>

<p>“Jove, but she’s certainly smashed up!” went
on the stout lad.</p>

<p>“The engine is nothing but junk,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“And look where the radiator is,” called Jerry.
“Up in that beech tree.” The cooling apparatus,
torn loose from the rest of the machinery had
caught on a great limb and hung there.</p>

<p>“She must have crashed full-tilt into the trees,”
was Ned’s opinion. “That tore things loose,
and then, if the engine was going, the propellers
threshed around and broke to pieces.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“That last is true, anyhow,” observed Bob.
“Here is a piece of one of the blades,” and he
held it up.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass was observed to be carefully
scanning the ground about the wreck.</p>

<p>“Are you looking for the treasure?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that? Treasure? No, my
dear boy, I’m looking for the flying frog. This
seems a likely place to find one.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll have a look for the treasure,” said
Ned, smiling at the odd indifference of the professor.
“It ought to be somewhere around here—if
Brown and Black, or whatever their names
are—told the truth.”</p>

<p>After a glance at the wrecked craft the three
boys began eagerly looking for the loot from the
bank.</p>

<p>“First we’d better make sure it isn’t still
aboard,” suggested Jerry. “They had two or
three compartments on their craft where they
could carry the money.”</p>

<p>It needed but the most casual glance, however,
to show that none of the treasure was now
aboard the <i>Silver Star</i>. In fact the several compartments
or boxes of which Jerry had spoken
were smashed beyond holding anything. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
corner of one, however, where it had become
jammed, was part of the same curious implement
that had first aroused their suspicions.</p>

<p>“That’s the drill they used to make a hole in
the safe door, so they could put in the explosive,”
declared Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’d better take it along for evidence,”
remarked Jerry, as he carried the tool
to their own machine.</p>

<p>“And there’s not so much as a gold-piece here,”
gloomily went on Ned, after a careful survey of
the ground about the wreck. “I guess they’ve
got it hidden somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you,” declared Jerry. “I
think it was in the ship after they were spilled
out. How long it remained after that we can’t
say. But I’m going to have a look back over
the air path which this machine took in coming
here.”</p>

<p>They were hopeful at first, but when, after a
walk of several hours, they had not even found
a scrap of paper they began to get discouraged.
All about them was the vast, silent forest, in
which it seemed that the foot of man had not
been set since the Indians had disappeared.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” declared Bob, sitting down on a
stone. “I wish I’d brought along something to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
eat. I’m going back. You fellows can hunt, if
you want to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, just a little farther,” urged
Jerry. “Go one more mile, and then, if we don’t
find something we’ll go back, and try it again to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, just one mile more,” stipulated the fat
lad wearily.</p>

<p>They trudged on, poking about in the dead
leaves for a sight of gold or paper. They had
about covered the additional mile, and Bob was
urging his companions to return, when, as he impatiently
kicked at a stone, he uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“Hurt yourself?” asked Jerry, turning around.</p>

<p>Bob did not answer. He dug his fist down into
the leaves and dirt, and when he raised his hand
his fingers clutched something that glittered in the
sun.</p>

<p>“Gold! Gold!” he cried. “A twenty dollar
gold piece!”</p>

<p>“The airship treasure at last!” shouted Jerry.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after that Ned found
three of the double eagles scattered about, and
Jerry picked up five more close together. Then
they hurried along the track, as indicated by the
gold, and in a few minutes they came upon a
bundle of papers. The wrappings were torn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
off, and then to the delighted gaze of the boys
there were disclosed big bundles of bills, and the
other securities that had been stolen from the
bank vault. Jerry hastily counted them over.</p>

<p>“There’s two hundred and six thousand dollars
here,” he announced.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” confirmed Ned. “There was
four thousand in gold taken. Let’s see if we
can’t pick up some more.”</p>

<p>They hurried back to the place where they had
first found the glittering coins, and by dint of
searching in the leaves managed to pick up one
hundred and ten of the coins—twenty-two hundred
dollars. Then, as it was getting late, and
they wanted to make secure the great treasure
they had found, they went back to their craft.</p>

<p>As they came in view of it they saw Professor
Snodgrass capering about like a boy.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah!” he shouted at the sight
of them. “I’ve found it!”</p>

<p>“Maybe he found the rest of the gold,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ve got most of the treasure!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“And I’ve got my treasure—my prize—the
flying frog!” exclaimed the scientist. “I just
caught it! Oh, but I am the lucky man! Congratulate
me, boys!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look here!” called Jerry, showing the big
bundle of notes.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, very good, very good,” spoke the
professor calmly, “but look at this,” and, trembling
with eagerness, he opened a specimen box
and showed the boys a tiny, trembling green
frog. “I had rather have this than the airship
treasure,” said the professor. “You ought to see
it change color.”</p>

<p>He agreed with the boys that it was useless to
spend any more time hunting for the rest of the
gold. It had evidently been scattered when the
airship turned over, spilling out the other valuables,
just before crashing into the trees.</p>

<p>“The bank will be glad enough to get that back,
and with the capture of the robbers, to pay you
the reward,” said the professor.</p>

<p>The airship treasure was carefully put aboard
the <i>Comet</i> and then, rising high in the air, the
nose of the craft was pointed toward the east,
and she began her swift flight again over the
pathless forest.</p>

<p>“Well, something was doing on this trip, almost
all the while,” remarked Ned, a day or so
later when they were nearing Harmolet.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was one of the most exciting ones we’ve
had,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not the last voyage of our heroes,
for they were destined for other adventures, which
will be related in the next volume, to be entitled,
“The Motor Boys After a Fortune; Or The Hut
on Snake Island.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know the secret of the cloth on the
statue and how Noddy’s and Bill’s names came
in the torch,” said Bob.</p>

<p>They did learn a little later, at the trial of
the robbers. It became necessary to have evidence
about the queer bicycle tires, and Noddy,
being a witness, explained how he had purchased
a set exactly like those on the <i>Silver Star</i> from a
supply left by Brown and Black.</p>

<p>It developed at the trial that Noddy had proposed
to Bill the daring scheme of sailing around
the head of the statue in the park, and lifting
off a loose portion of the torch as a trophy.
Noddy thought it would show his skill as an aviator,
and that the people of Harmolet would be
much surprised when they found the piece of
bronze gone. It was this scheme he was proposing
to his crony, when Jerry overheard him.
Noddy had been in Harmolet before, and knew
about the statue.</p>

<p>But Noddy had a slight accident in his machine
after leaving the Colton grounds, and so could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
not start to circle the statue until after dark.
Then the park was deserted and no one saw him.
He had his trouble for his pains, and found it impossible
to take away a piece of the bronze. He
and Bill went too close, and tore one of their
wing tips. Noddy did manage to toss his name
and Bill’s into the hollow torch, a foolish and
risky trick.</p>

<p>They escaped police detection, which Bill was
afraid of, but gained none of the notoriety for
which Noddy thirsted. Then the two went off
on an auto trip that lasted until they were summoned
to court.</p>

<p>“It’s no wonder though, after what happened,
and remembering Noddy’s talk, that we suspected
them for a time,” said Jerry; and his chums
agreed with him.</p>

<p>The trial of the two robbers, who went under
various names, was short and summary. They
had recovered from their accident when taken
to court. The evidence against them, given by
the boys, was so conclusive, that they did not offer
a defense, and were quickly convicted.</p>

<p>It developed that the day they were in the little
country town, where the boys first saw them,
they were planning the robbery, and the mention
of Harmolet so startled them that they betrayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
a nervousness that drew the attention of our
friends to them.</p>

<p>The boys had found nearly all the gold, for
what was missing had been spent by the thieves.
The evil doers were sent to prison for long terms.</p>

<p>Of course our heroes received the ten thousand
dollars reward, and the thanks of the bank
officials. The prize money was divided among
them, Professor Snodgrass getting his share.
Nor did the boys forget the friendly policeman,
Mr. Thompson, but for whose aid they might
not have gotten on the trail of the thieves.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass returned to the museum,
the proud possessor of the flying frog, as well as
many other specimens gathered on the trip. As
for the boys, they had several more trips in the
<i>Comet</i> and then prepared to return to school
in the fall. Anxiously then, they awaited the
next summer, when they planned to do great
things.</p>

<p>And now, for the time being we will say good-bye
to the motor boys, trusting to meet them soon
again.</p>
